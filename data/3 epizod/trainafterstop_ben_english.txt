What are you doing out here?
7) LEE

8) BEN
{fearA}I guess not.
9) BEN
{fearA}I, uh, couldn't be back there anymore. {sadB}I needed some air.
10) BEN
{sadC}I was thinking about talking to Kenny...
11) BEN
{sadA}Yeah... {thinkingA}you, me and Kenny. Clementine. {fearB}The homeless dude, if he sticks around.

17) LEE
{sadB}There's not much use in describing people by who they were.

{disgustA}You know what I mean.
20) LEE
{sadC}We just don't know.
21) LEE
{thinkingA}Why didn't you try to find them?
22) BEN
{thinkingA}I guess.
23) LEE
{angryA}Well, what happened to Kenny is different.
24) BEN
[pickup 2] [new read:Emphasis is off. Should be 'nobody would GO with me' not 'nobody would go WITH

Not really.
52) 
Not much choice.
54) LEE
[pickup2] [cold and dissmissive, do you still want to talk to me after i got everyone killed?] {angryA}Not really.
55) BEN
[pickup2][sad] {sadC}I didn't think so.
56) LEE
[pickup2]{angryA}I don't have a lot of choice, unless you're going somewhere.
57) BEN
[pickup2]{fearA}I...I guess I'm not. [are you going anywhere? like, are you leaving the group since you fucked up so bad?]
