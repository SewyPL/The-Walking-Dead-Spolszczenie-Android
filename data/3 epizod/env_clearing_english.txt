12) LEE
{sadA}{body-A}I'm saying we shouldn't stay put.
13) LEE
{sadB}{body-B}Take as long as you need.
14) KENNY
[upset] {fearA}{body-A}There ain't no time left to take.

{fearA}{body-A}What are we gonna do?
20) KENNY
{fearA}{body-A}But {fearB}{body-A}what if...
21) KATJAA
We can't allow him to become one of those things.
22) 
Katjaa should do it.
23) 
Kenny should do it.
24) 
I'll do it.
33) KENNY
{FearA}I'll do it.
25) KENNY
{disgustA}{body-A}There's...
26) KATJAA
If you think of one, you let me know.
27) KENNY
{fearB}{body-A}Isn't there some sort of pill, {fearB}or something we can just give him....
28) KATJAA
Stop it.
29) KENNY

32) KATJAA
You don't have to.

No. You don't HAVE to.
35) KENNY
{AngryC}Katjaa, fuck, [gets panicky choked up] {SadA}I can. {SadB}I can do this. [he can't]
36) KATJAA
You can't. I love you, Ken. But this is beyond you.
37) KATJAA
Lee, be with him?
38) KATJAA
No, hon. Stay with Lee. Your son loves you and you should remember him as the silly boy we used to have. Not this.
39) KENNY
{fearA}{body-A}I can't...
40) KENNY
[emotional collapse]
41) KENNY

146) DUCK
[a couple small, pained weezes]
147) KENNY
[exhale, dropping the gun that you were pointing at your son's head]

48) CLEMENTINE
I thought he was going to die.
96) CLEMENTINE
I thought he was going to die.
49) CLEMENTINE
What is Katjaa doing?
50) LEE
{SadA}{body-F}Nothing, {NormalD}everything is fine.
51) CLEMENTINE
No it's not.
52) 
She's killing him.
53) 
She's making sure he's okay.
54) 
She's putting him out of his misery.
55) LEE
{SadA}{body-f}Look, Clem. Things will --{surpriseB}
102) LEE
{SadA}{body-f}Look, Clem. Things will --{surpriseB}
56) KENNY
[face in hands, just a total wreck] NOOO, GOD....!
57) 
This will never happen to you.
58) 
It had to be done.
59) 
People die.
60) CLEMENTINE
Not anymore.
61) CLEMENTINE
The walkers aren't dead. People don't die anymore. Not right away at least.
62) LEE
{NormalD}{body-F}People die.
63) LEE
{disgustB}Well, Katjaa made sure Duck did.
65) KENNY
[over his shoulder. flat, cold] {fearA}{body-A}I'm gonna go get her. {disgustA}She's probably a mess.
66) LEE
[pickup 2] [ new read: - A little too 'by the book' order. Duck just was killed, could be more empathatic.] {DisgustB}{body-F}Ben, get Clementine on the train, all right? {AngryA}{body-B}And keep your eyes open.
67) KENNY
{SurprisedA}{body-A}[horrified] Guh!
68) KENNY
{FearC}{body-A}KAT! KAT! KATJAA!
70) 
We still have to deal with Duck.
72) KENNY
{SadA}{body-A}[emotionally dead] What do we do.
73) KENNY
{FearC}{body-A}Why, Kat? Honey, oh fuckin' God...
74) KENNY
{SadB}{body-A}[whatever you feel like "saying," you're over the body of your dead wife]
75) KENNY
{FearC}{body-A}You said you could do it, Kat, {SadB} god dammit, you said you could do it!
76) 
Give me the gun. I'll do it.
77) 
You do it. End this, Kenny.
78) LEE
{AngryA}{body-b}Give me the gun, Ken. I'll do it.
79) LEE
[pickup 2] [new read: Read too quickly. This is a tough thing to say to a friend, could be more sad.] {SadB}{body-b}You're his dad. You've gotta do this. {disgustB}Just put an end to it, man.
80) LEE
{disgustA}{body-B}Katjaa should do it, Ken. {disgustB}{body-B}She can handle it.

{AngryA}{body-B}I'll do it.
88) KENNY
{fearB}{body-A}Lee's right, Kat. {fearA}{body-A}We can say our goodbyes and{sadA}...
89) KATJAA
I don't know...
90) KATJAA
No. It should be a parent.
91) LEE
{AngryB}{body-B}No parent should have to do something like this.
92) KATJAA
Give us a moment to say goodbye?
93) KATJAA
Why don't we take him into the forest. So Clementine doesn't have to see.
94) KENNY
{sadB}{body-A}Yeah. [very sad]
95) LEE
{sadB}{body-B}Of course.
97) LEE

118) LEE
{FearA}{body-B}Yes I do.
119) CLEMENTINE
You don't know that.
120) LEE
{FearB}{body-F}[emphatic] This will never happen to you.
121) LEE
{normalD}There was no other choice.
122) CLEMENTINE
[another, sort of flat] Okay.
123) CLEMENTINE
[kind of in shock, flat] Okay.
124) LEE
{disgustB}{body-F}It had to be done.
127) LEE
{angryA}{body-f}I'm killing him.
129) LEE
{disgustB}By making sure he doesn't come back.
130) LEE
{disgustA}{body-f}I'm going to make sure he's okay.
134) LEE
{AngryA}{body-f}I'm putting him out of his misery.
137) 
What the hell happened?
138) LEE
[pickup 2] [new read: What the hell happened is shouted a little bit. The way the scene is set up, he's standing right next to Kenny. Also there's a weird disconnect between 'happened' and 'what'.] {SurpriseB}{body-B}What the hell happened? {FearA}What did you--
148) LEE

144) KENNY
{SadB}{body-A}She couldn't, she just, fuck, oh fuck...
141) LEE
{FearA}{Body-B}I'm so sorry.
142) LEE
{FearA}{Body-B}We still have to deal with Duck.
143) LEE
[pickup 2'] [ new read: 'by herself' is a weird read, almost angrily choked off, but it reads strange, not emotional. Could be more sad/angry.] {SadB}{body-B}Shouldn't have let her come out here {AngryA}by herself.
149) KENNY
{FearC}{body-A}I..I..couldn't....{FearB}so Kat took the gun..{SadA}and...{SadB}oh God, oh fuck....[choked up]
150) KENNY
{SadB}{Body-A}I...can't. Let's just go.
151)

160) KENNY
[pickup2][Your wife just told you she would be the one to put your kid down]Then I'm coming with you.
161) KATJAA
Stay with Lee. Your son loves you and you should remember him as the silly boy we used to have. Not this.
162) LEE
[pickup2] Let's go.
163) KENNY
[pickup2] [saying goodbye to his zombie son he's leaving in the woods] Goodbye... Duck.
164) KENNY
[pickup2] [saying goodbye to his dead family] Goodbuh... God. Goodbye, guys. I love you so much. [pull it back if you want, it's obviously so emotional a lot of words may not even come.]
165) KENNY
{sadB}come on, Kat...
166) KATJAA
I need you to hear me. What you are saying, that he may not turn, is foolish.
167) KATJAA
He's still a baby boy.
168) KATJAA
It would be different if he were older.
169) KATJAA
Let me do this.
170) KENNY
What if he doesn't?
171) KENNY
...just let that be it.
172) KATJAA
Lee, you'd be doing this family a great service.
