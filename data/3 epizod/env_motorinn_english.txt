{happya}That's Robin.
9) LEE
{angryb}[annoyed] I know who it is.
10)

25) DUCK
{happyB}Yes!
26) LEE
{ThinkingB}Okay, you're Robin.
31) LEE
{thinkingA} There's some broken glass on the ground there.
32) LEE
{thinkingA}Hmm.
33) LEE
{thinkingB}There's something drawn there...
34) DUCK
{happyA}A clue!
35) LEE
{angryA}[frustrated] Maybe.
36) DUCK
{normalA}What do you think it is?
37) LEE
{thinkingA}Huh. Chalk.
38) DUCK
{thinkingA}[whispering] Pink. Hmm.
39) LEE
{angryB}[surprised]Duck!
40) LEE
{angryC}I thought I told you couldn't help.
41) DUCK
{sadA}I'm curious.
42) LEE
{thinkingB}You don't say.
43) LEE
{thinkingB}I don't think it's anything.
44) DUCK
{happyb}Maybe it's a sign!
45) LEE
{normalB}It could be. {thinkingA}It's pink chalk, which is {thinkingb}weird.
46) DUCK
{thinkingA}Okay, {happyA}back to investigating!
47) LEE
{thinkingA}More chalk...
48) LEE
{normalC}Somebody was over here too.
49) LEE
{normalA}Yeah, Duck, you did.
50) DUCK
{happya}See, I did good, huh.
51) DUCK
{normalA}Okay.
52) LEE
{thinkingA}I suppose I should go out there and look around.
53) LEE
{normalA}You stay here this time. {normalC}Seriously.
54) LEE
{normalB}Not gonna shoot that.
55) LEE
{thinkingA}Huh. There's {fearA}something in there... [worried]
56) LEE
{normalB}There's a grate down there.
57) LEE
{thinkingB}[tiny effort] Hmmph.
58) LEE
{normalB}It's a bag of something.
59) LEE
{fearA}[disbelief, quiet] Son of a bitch...
60) LEE
{thinkingA}Sounds like Kenny actually has that thing running. {HappyA}I'll believe it when I see it.
61) LEE
{normalA} It's Lilly's room.
62) LEE
{normalB}I don't need to go in there.
63) LEE
{normalB}It's locked up.

{happyA}I found something.
65) LEE
{thinkingA}What is it?
66) LEE
{thinkingA}Yeah, Duck, I got it. {normalA}Good job.
67) DUCK
{happyc}Cool!
68) DUCK
{happyb}I found this piece of pink chalk and a scuff of it over by the gate!
69) LEE
{normalA}Really?
70) DUCK
{happyc}Totally!
71) DUCK
{normalA}Psst, Lee.
72) DUCK
{happya}I was combing the scene for clues and--
73) KATJAA

108) LEE

77) DOUG
And now if she's paranoid? That's a bad mix.
106) DOUG
And now if she's paranoid? That's a bad mix.
78) DOUG
I don't know what it is but it's probably worth talking to Lilly about things going missing. Ever since her dad died she's been a live wire.
109) DOUG
I don't know what it is but it's probably worth talking to Lilly about things going missing. Ever since her dad died she's been a live wire.

82) CARLEY
Well, I think you did good today. And I find myself thinking that most days.
117) CARLEY
Well, I think you did good today. And I find myself thinking that most days.
83) CARLEY
It's probably worth following up with Lilly about what she was saying about missing supplies.
112) CARLEY
It's probably worth following up with Lilly about what she was saying about missing supplies.
84) CARLEY
With her wound up the way she is, I don't want to see her paranoid.
114) CARLEY
With her wound up the way she is, I don't want to see her paranoid.
85) LEE
{normalA}Thanks.
116) LEE

86) CARLEY
Oof. Things are coming to a head.
111) CARLEY

And I'd like to talk, when you've got a minute.

125) LEE
{angryA}She's right, you know. {normalC}Shit's just getting worse by the day.
94) KENNY
{angryA}Whatever, Lee. You've picked your sides.
123) KENNY
{angryA}Whatever, Lee. You've picked your sides.
95) KATJAA
{sadA}Ken, that's not fair.
124) KATJAA
{sadA}Ken, that's not fair.
96) 
Happy, Kenny?
97) LEE
{AngryA} Happy, Kenny?
126) 
Happy, Kenny?
127) LEE
