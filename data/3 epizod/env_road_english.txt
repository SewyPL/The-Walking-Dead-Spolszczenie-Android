{HappyA}Me, too.
267) CLEMENTINE
{HappyA}Really?
268) LEE
{HappyA}She was a really small lady. {ThinkingB}It was strange.
270) LEE
{SadA}I know.
271) 
This one time...
302) 
This one time...
272) CLEMENTINE
{SadC}What happened? [tired]
273) LEE
{HappyA}This one time {NormalD}my brother thought it would be {AngryA}funny to {NormalC}fill her tuba {HappyA}full of flour on April Fool's day.
274) LEE
{HappyB}Yeah. {NormalD}I don't know why I remembered that.
275) LEE
{HappyC}Just about what you'd expect.
276) CLEMENTINE
[a really small laugh] {HappyB}That's funny.
277) LEE
{NormalA}And that same day {HappyA}she thought it'd be funny to wake me up for school by {HappyB}playing it right in my face.
278) 
Never mind.
308) 
Never mind.
279) CLEMENTINE
{ThinkingB}Okay. {NormalA}It doesn't sound that bad.
310) CLEMENTINE
{ThinkingB}Okay. {NormalA}It doesn't sound that bad.
280) LEE
[sleepy] {ThinkingA}It's not.
311) LEE
[sleepy] {ThinkingA}It's not.
281) LEE
{NormalB}Anyway. {NormalD}Let's...{ThinkingA}let's try not to worry about Duck too much yet.
309) LEE
{NormalB}Anyway. {NormalD}Let's...{ThinkingA}let's try not to worry about Duck too much yet.
282) 
I'm glad I have you.
285) LEE
{HappyC}I'm glad I have you.
283) CLEMENTINE
{SadC}I heard you outside my treehouse that day {SadB}and thought about {ThinkingA}dropping a hammer on your head.
286) 
What? Why?
287) LEE
{HappyA}The door was open.
288) CLEMENTINE
{HappyA}He was dumb.
289) CLEMENTINE
{ThinkingA}He wanted to take the TV and {NormalB}tried to break the glass door with a rock.
290) CLEMENTINE
{FearB}In case you were up to no good.
291) LEE
{ThinkingB}What? {HappyB}Why?
292) CLEMENTINE
{NormalC}Then some walkers came {ThinkingB}and scared him away.
293) CLEMENTINE
Before you there was this other guy. He was yelling and trying to get into my house.
294) 
Hmm. That's nice.
295) CLEMENTINE
{HappyA}I didn't though.
296) LEE
{ThinkingB}Hmm. {DisgustB}That's nice.
297) LEE
{AngryA}Thanks.
298) 
My brother almost died, once.
301) LEE
{NormalC}My brother almost died, once.
299) LEE
{HappyA}Oh yeah. {NormalD}It was scary though.
300) CLEMENTINE
{FearA}But he lived?
303) LEE
{HappyC}He teaches all three of 'em a lesson. {ThinkingB}But the truck's still moving, you see, and {NormalD}just as he stands up to {NormalC}jump out, {ThinkingA}it zooms underneath a tree and a {AngryA}branch hits him square in the face and he goes {NormalD}flying out the back.
304) LEE
{NormalD}This one time, these {AngryA}boys from the other side of town were {DisgustB}hassling him.
305) LEE
{AngryA}He was on his bike and {SadA}they were in a truck throwing things at him, {NormalD}calling him names; {ThinkingB}stuff like that.
306) LEE
{HappyC}And this tough son of a gun, {HappyB}he peddles up after them and {NormalD}he catches them. {HappyA}He pulls his bike up alongside the truck {HappyB}and jumps into the back and {FearA}starts beating on 'em.
307) LEE
{AngryA}Anyway, if he can live {HappyA}through that, {ThinkingA}I'm sure Duck {HappyA}can live through this.
312) LEE
{ThinkingA}Yeah it is.
470) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2] Yeah, it is.
313) CLEMENTINE
{SadC}Everything is bad right now.

342) DOUG

422) BEN
{SadE}Look, {SadB}just let me out. {FearB}I didn't do it, {SadD}but I don't like this; {SadB}I don't like where it's headed.

You're right. Deal with this now.
439) LILLY
{AngryB}Then what do we {AngryC}NOT forgive? {SadB}Honestly, tell me. {ThinkingA}Kenny can kill my dad; {SadB}Carley can {SadC}steal from us? {DisgustA}Where's the line?
441) 
Carley's trustworthy.
442) LEE
{ThinkingB}Carley's trustworthy. {AngryA}She's not a {DisgustA}traitor, Lilly.
444) CARLEY
{AngryB}Don't be ridiculous.
445) LILLY
{AngryA}She can fight her own battles. {DisgustB}Unless there's something going on here {ThinkingB}that implicates you both.
446) 
Why her?
447) CARLEY
{FearB}Whoa, {AngryD}my family's {AngryC}not a bunch of meth-riddled {DisgustA}forest people. {AngryD}They're fucking Lutheran!
448) CARLEY
{AngryC}It wasn't ME.
449) LILLY
{AngryE}She's always {AngryB}SO eager to see {ThinkingB}what supplies we found. {AngryE}She never talks about her family. {AngryA}She could be {AngryB}related to those bastards for all we know.
450) LEE
{ThinkingB}Why her? {AngryA}This seems like {DisgustB}a stab in the dark, Lilly.
451) LILLY
{ThinkingA}You're not saying it wasn't you.
452) 
Maybe it was her.
453) LEE
{ThinkingB}Maybe it was her.
