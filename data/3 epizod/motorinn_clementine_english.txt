[pickup2]What's that you're working on, Clem?
78) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2]It's called a leaf rubbing. My teacher Miss Moore showed us how to
do ï¿½em when we went to the Botanical Garden once.
79) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2][holds up a half-completed rubbing in one hand and the leaf in the
other] See? It's the same! Uhm, kind of.
