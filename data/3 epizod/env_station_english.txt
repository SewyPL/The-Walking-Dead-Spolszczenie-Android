1) CLEMENTINE
Sorry.
2) LEE
{normalc}{body-B}You should wait for me before trying to open doors.
3) LEE
{thinkinga}Luckily it's locked. {happya}We'll get better at working together.
4) CLEMENTINE
Maybe I could look in?
5) LEE
{thinkinga}{body-b}The window's open up there.
6) CLEMENTINE
Sounds good.
7) LEE
{happya}{body-b}Why don't I put you on my shoulders and you can peek into that window up there.
8) LEE
{normalb}{body-b}We'll have to find a way in.
9) 
What do you see?
10) 
Getting this door open is going to be tough.
11) 
Jump in if you can.
12) LEE
{sada}{body-B}What do you see?
13) CLEMENTINE
Lots of crates and stuff.
14) CLEMENTINE
I think I opened it.
15) LEE
{surpriseb}{body-B}For real?
16) CLEMENTINE
I think so.
17) LEE
{happyc}Well I'll be damned.
18) CLEMENTINE
Let's go. Be careful.
19) LEE
{happyb}{body-B}I'm supposed to tell you that.
20) LEE
{thinkinga}Maybe we can find the key or figure out a way to knock this door down. {normalb}Kenny'd probably have me pick the lock, {thinkinga}which actually might work now that we have the time... {thinkingb}Hmm....
23) LEE
{thinkinga}Maybe we can find the key or figure out a way to knock this door down. {normalb}Kenny'd probably have me pick the lock, {thinkinga}which actually might work now that we have the time... {thinkingb}Hmm....
21) LEE
{angrya}{body-B}Getting this door open is going to be tough.
22) CLEMENTINE
It might not be that hard.
24) LEE
{normala}{body-B}Jump in if you can.
25) CLEMENTINE
What about staying together?
26) LEE
{angrya}If there aren't any walkers in there, {happya}you'll be fine.
27) CLEMENTINE
It's too far to fall.
28) LEE
{normald}Well, what do you think we should do?
29) CLEMENTINE
Grr... fine. Can you get me closer, please?
30) CLEMENTINE
Okay, I can see in, what do I do now?
31) CLEMENTINE
Maybe I can hold the door open?
32) LEE
{angryb}I don't like that. {normalb}I'll prop it open with something.
33) LEE
{angrya}Goddamn it's dark in here.
34) CLEMENTINE
It's way too dark.
35) LEE
{angrya}{body-B}Yeah, you're right.
36) LEE
{sadb}I don't like it when I only have our gun to protect us.
107) LEE
{sadb}I don't like it when I only have our gun to protect us.
110) LEE
{sadb}I don't like it when I only have our gun to protect us.
37) CLEMENTINE
The noise, right?
108) CLEMENTINE
The noise, right?
112) CLEMENTINE
The noise, right?
38) LEE
{happya}Exactly.
109) LEE
{happya}Exactly.
111) LEE
{happya}Exactly.
39) LEE
{angryc}{body-b}[shoulder shove into door]
77) LEE
{sadc}{body-b}[recovering]
40) LEE
{sada}Yeah, won't budge.
41) LEE
{thinkinga}{body-b}I can't see in there.
42) LEE
{happyb}{body-b}How we doin'?
43) CLEMENTINE
Good. What do we need?
44) LEE
{normalb}Something to help us deal with the tanker out there.
45) LEE
{sada}{body-b}You okay going over the top of this fence?
46) CLEMENTINE
Yeah, definitely.
47) LEE
{normalb}{body-b}The keys are on the opposite wall. {angrya}Grab them and get this gate open.
48) LEE
{thinkinga}{body-b}It's locked up good, {normalc}but there's some space at the top.
49) CLEMENTINE
We're lucky I'm so little.
50) LEE
{happyb}Yeah, we are.
51) LEE
{angryb}{body-b}Goddammit, it's locked!
52) LEE
{angrya}{body-b}Locked up good.
53) LEE
{angryc}{body-b}Fuck, it's still locked!
54) LEE
{angrya}That's exactly {happya}what we need.
55) CLEMENTINE
Over there?
56) LEE
{normalb}Yeah. We need to get in there and get that blowtorch.
57) LEE
[phew]  {happyb}{body-b}We got it.
58) CLEMENTINE
Let's go outside now.
59) LEE
{normalb}What did we learn?
60) CLEMENTINE
I'm not ready for a gun.
61) LEE
{angrya}No, Clem. We learned that everything we will ever do is dangerous. {normalc}We'll get better, smarter and faster. {happya}Okay?
62) CLEMENTINE
Okay.
63) LEE
{normalb}{body-b}There are keys over there.
64) CLEMENTINE
For the gate?
65) LEE
{sada}I hope so.
66) LEE
{angrya}{body-b}Can't reach 'em from here.
67) LEE
{sada}{body-b}Wish that thing was in my hands instead of over there.
68) CLEMENTINE
It's too dark otherwise.
69) LEE
{happyb}{body-b}Go on and grab the keys, Clem.
70) LEE
{normalb}Come on, scoot.
71) CLEMENTINE
{fearb}{body-stand}Behind you!
72) LEE
{surpriseB}Fuck!
73) LEE
{angryC}[UGH!]
152) CHRISTA
{angryb}[frustrated exhale, short, upon exit]
74) LEE
{sada}{body-b}It's okay...it's okay... everything's fine.
75) LEE
{angryC}KEYS! NOW!
76) LEE
{angryd}SHIIIT!
78) LEE
{angryb}God...damn...
79) CLEMENTINE
That didn't go so good.
80) LEE
{sada}No, it did {surpriseb}not go so good. {normalb}But we're okay. {happya}Everything's okay.

124) LEE
[pickup2] [unnerved] We're fine.
125) LEE
[pickup2] [not sure what to say] We found some walkers.
126) CHRISTA
{thinkinga}You and an eight year old versus three of them, huh?
127) 
We handled it.
136) LEE
[pickup2] We handled it.
128) 
Mind your own business.
129) 
It was stupid.
133) LEE
[pickup2] It was stupid.
130) LEE
[pickup2] Mind your own business. If we wanted you to help out we would've asked.
131) CHRISTA
{angrya}If you two were to die in here, three dead turns to five and THAT'S my business.
132) LEE
[pickup2] Good thing it didn't happen, then.
134) CHRISTA
{normalb}You think? [sarc but stern]
135) LEE
[pickup2] What do you want me to say? I'm trying to teach her how to take care of herself. We're getting used to working together.
137) CHRISTA
{normalb}Yeah, it looks like. {angrya}What if you hadn't?
138) CHRISTA
{thinkinga}....Looks like it worked out for you. {normalb}Probably ought to be a little more careful when using a gun. Noise and all.
139) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2] We know.
140) CHRISTA
{normalb}I'm going to go make sure the noise didn't cause us any problems.
141) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2] That's a good idea.
142) CHRISTA
{angryA}I hope you know what you're doing with her.
143) 
We're still alive, aren't we?

Me too.

I don't.

[pickup2]I don't.
147) CHRISTA

[pickup2] No, you just have to learn to pull the trigger.
166) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2] It's so hard.
167) LEE
[pickup2] Don't think, just do it. Live with what happens.
168) LEE
[pickup2] We learned not to be afraid. They shoulda got us, but we got them.
169) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2] Yeah, you're right.
170) LEE
[pickup2] Fear is the thing that will kill us, you understand?
171) LEE
[pickup2] Me, neither.
172) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2] I'm sorry. I'll get better. I don't want us to die.

179) LEE
[pickup2] Somebody was doing some painting.

182) LEE
[pickup2] Doesn't look like that thing's worked for years.
183) LEE
