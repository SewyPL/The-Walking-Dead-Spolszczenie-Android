1) KENNY
[flat] {normalC} Next stop, the Atlantic.
2) LEE
{thinkingA} We have to find a boat. {normalD} We just have to.
3) KENNY
{sadA} We will.
4) LEE
{thinkingA} I just think it's time she and I parted ways with you. {normalD} Omid and Christa can make their own call.
5) LEE
{sadA} I'm sorry, we made a plan. {thinkingA} We talked it through.
6) LEE
{disgustA} We're going our own way, {normalC} Clementine and me.
7) KENNY
{disgustA} What the fuck does that mean?
8) KENNY
{angryA} Hmmph.
9) KENNY
That's not the plan.
10) KENNY
I thought they were dead.
11) LEE
[pickup 2] [new read: Odd pause after 'parents' and before 'get there.'] {normalD} We're finding Clementine's parents when we get there.
12) LEE
{disgustA} Well, it's ours. {normalC} She and I talked it through.
13) LEE
{thinkingA} Looking for them, then.
14) 
You'll never get over today.
20) LEE
{sadA} You'll never get over today.
15) 
You'll be all right.
22) LEE
{thinkingA} You'll be all right.
16) 
It's just gotten too bad.
17) KENNY
{sadA} That's why I keep thinking it.
18) KENNY
{sadC} That's all I keep thinking.
19) LEE
{thinkingA} Try to think about what's ahead of you.
21) KENNY
{sadA} I'll be alive, I guess. {sadC} Blood in my heart, blood in my brain at least.
28) KENNY
{sadA} I'll be alive, I guess. {sadC} Blood in my heart, blood in my brain at least.
23) LEE
{normalD} It's gotten too bad, you know? {sadA} You, me, {thinkingB} nobody can take all this.
24) KENNY
[big sigh] {sadB} Me, too.
25) KENNY
{sadC} But we have.
26) LEE
{sadA} What we're supposed to do isn't clear anymore. {disgustA} I'd give anything to go back to fighting over the motel.
27) KENNY
{sadC} Yeah. There ain't much to say.
29) LEE
{surpriseB} Holy shit...
30) CAMPMAN
[radio processed] Hell...o...oo...there?...
31) CAMPMAN
[radio processed] Can't wait for you to get to Savannah, Clementine. I told your parents what you're doing and they can't wait to see you. Now, what I nee--[radio cuts out]
32) LEE
{thinkingA} She's out cold like I never seen.
33) LEE
{disgustB} What the...?
34) LEE
{normalD} I'll leave you to your thoughts.
35) KENNY
[heavy] {disgustA} Ya'll might want to rethink your plan.
36) LEE
{fearA} Who the fuck...
37) KENNY
{thinkingA} I don't know, {angryA} but we're going to find out.
38) KENNY
{disgustA} Sounds like somebody knows where we're headed.
39) KENNY
[pickup2] I thought that fucking thing was broken...
40) LEE
[pickup2] So did I.
41) KENNY
[pickup2] [alt] Well, it sounds like somebody knows where we're headed.
42) KENNY
[pickup2] I don't know. But I doubt we're going to be happy when we find out.
43) CAMPMAN
[pickup2][radioprocessed] Can't wait for you to get to Savannah, Clementine. I've got your parents right here, and you be sure to find me whether Lee wants you to or not. Now, what I need-- [radio cuts out]
44) CAMPMAN
[pickup2] Can't wait for you to get to Savannah. I know you said Lee wants to help, but your parents want you to come alone, Clementine. I need you to--
45) LEE
[pickup2] Who the fuck was that... if he's convinced Clementine that he has her parents...
