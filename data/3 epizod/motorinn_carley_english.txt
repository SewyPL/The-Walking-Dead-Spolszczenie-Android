1) CARLEY
{normalA}What I wanted to say was, {happyA}I've been thinking a lot. {happyb}About you.
2) 
I think about you too.
5) LEE
{happya}I think about you too.
3) 
What about?
8) LEE
{normalA}What about?
4) 
I'm fine.
9) LEE
{normalD}I'm fine.
6) CARLEY
{happya}[nervously smitten, just a touch] Our group is small.
7) LEE
[pickup 2] [new read note: This could be more flirty. As is, it's a bit flat.] {happyb}[flirting "our group is small"]You're small.
10) CARLEY
{thinkingA}Don't brood. I know you're "fine."
11) LEE
{AngryA}Carley, Jesus...
12) CARLEY
{normalC}People need to know because we're hanging by a {sadA}thread here and I can't see Lilly talk about you without thinking it's the next thing she's gonna say.
13) CARLEY
{normalB}You're a convicted killer.
14) CARLEY
{normalC}[stepping closer] And I think people should know.
15) CARLEY
{sadA}Not because they deserve to and not because you're a bad man. {normalA}I think the opposite of those two things.
16) 
It's a lifetime ago.
17) 
You're probably right.
22) LEE
{normald}You're probably right.
18) 
Forget it.
19) LEE
{sadA}It was a lifetime ago.
20) CARLEY
{angryA}Which is only going to make the feeling that you hid it and that there was even more to hide that much worse.
21) LEE
{angrya}[sigh]
23) CARLEY
{happyb}[flirty] Of course I'm probably right.
24) LEE
{normalC}Forget it. I have. You should too.
25) CARLEY
{angryA}God, I hate it when you do that. Don't you hear what I'm saying?
26) CARLEY
{angrya}[Frustrated] Larry's gone, but he knew. If he didn't tell Lilly outright, he probably said enough to make her wonder.
27) CARLEY
{normalB}And I know you told Kenny we met in your parent's drugstore, even though the first thing I ever said to you was keep a damn lid on it.
28) CARLEY
{normalB}I'll tell you what I would tell anybody, apocalypse or not -- there comes a time when you can get out ahead of something like this and discuss it on your terms.
29) CARLEY
{sadA}Do it before that chance is taken away.
30) CARLEY
{normalb}People might be pissed. {normalC}And telling them might cause some trouble, but it will be a far cry from what'll happen if they don't hear it from you.
31) LEE
{normalD}Yeah.
32) CARLEY
{normalB}So you'll do it then?
33) 
I'll let people know.
34) 
No.
160) CARLEY
{normalA}No.
35) LEE
{thinkingA}I'll let people know. {NormalB}You're totally right.
36) CARLEY
[warm] {happyA}Good. I think it's {fearA}for the best.
37) CARLEY
[whispers, like in your boyfriend's ear] {happyC}Don't call me small.
38) CARLEY
[whisper in ear] {happyC}Try not to play stoic. It makes your forehead crinkle.
39) CARLEY
[whispered in lee's ear] {happyC}You're gonna have to be more talkative if this is gonna work.
40) CARLEY
[whispered in lee's ear] {happyC}You'll thank me later.
41) LEE
{AngryA}No. I'm not doing that. {NormalD}People have enough to worry about.
42) CARLEY
{fearA}What are you so afraid of? {ThinkingA}Three months ago I told you to tell no one and now I'm telling you to tell everyone. Do you think it's because they'll turn on you? {AngryC}We almost got eaten for fuck's sake.
43) CARLEY
{normalA}Things are different now.
44) CARLEY
{fearA}I hope you change your mind.
45) CARLEY
{NormalA}Now. Um, {fearA}is there anything else you want to talk about?
46) LEE
{thinkingA}No, actually, I'm going to go.
47) CARLEY
{normalA}Okay.
161) LEE
{normalA}Okay.
48) CARLEY
{normalb}Good idea.
49) LEE
{thinkingA}I'm going to look into this thing.
50) LEE
{normalA}I'll talk to you later.
51) CARLEY
{happyA}I'll talk to YOU later.

{happyA}He was cool. He just worries about his family.
113) LEE
{happyA}He was cool. He just worries about his family.
74) LEE
{sadA}I don't know. Feels like I just gave him ammo if we ever have to make any tough decisions when it comes to a head count.
114) LEE
{sadA}I don't know. Feels like I just gave him ammo if we ever have to make any tough decisions when it comes to a head count.

84) LEE
{thinkingA}There's some broken equipment too. {normalA}I'll look into it.
85) LEE
{normalb}No, not yet. {normalA} I will.
86) LEE
{sadA}She was fine, I guess. I think she's more upset about Kenny.
121) LEE
{sadA}She was fine, I guess. I think she's more upset about Kenny.
87) CARLEY
{sadA}Because of the St. Johns? What exactly did he do back there?

141) CARLEY
{thinkingA}I don't know, this place is fine but we all know that that could change any second.
143) CARLEY
{normalB}Show me a bath with a heated floor in a highrise apartment and hand me a full-bodied Malbec, and then I'll feel safe.
145) CARLEY

163) CARLEY
{normalA}And the batteries might be in backwards.
164) CARLEY
{normalA}It's broken.
165) CARLEY
[pickup2] But everyone's different. Who knows how each person would take it, you know? Maybe it's worth thinking about who you want to tell.
166) CARLEY
[pickup2] You don't have to tell everyone, but think about who you trust and take the opportunity while you have it.
