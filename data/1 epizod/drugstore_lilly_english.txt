{HappyC}I've got the keys.
104) LEE
{HappyC}I've got the keys.
12) LEE
{SadB}Yeah, that's not really an option right now.
13) LEE
{sadA}What's wrong with him?
16) 
What's wrong with him?
14) LILLY
{sadA}I'm just trying to keep him relaxed.
15) LILLY
{sadA}He's got a heart condition. He takes nitroglycerin tablets pretty regularly. {fearA}I've seen a few bad attacks that he couldn't get over and needed to go to the hospital.
17) LARRY
[having bad chest pains, this is an aside] {AngryC}Ah, fuck you.
18) LILLY
{SadB}Yeah... he doesn't mean it.
19) LEE
{ThinkingB}It's just that...
21) LEE
{AngryA}He's got a temper.
22) 
He's got a temper.
23) LILLY
{AngryC}It's just his way. {AngryB}Don't make him the reason everything's screwed.
24) LILLY
{NormalB}He and I are a family.
25) LEE
[Whisper, intimate convo distance]{ThinkingA}We've got kids here, {SadA}families.
26) LEE
{SadB}I'm just saying some people can't handle a temper like that. {AngryA}Hell, it barely seems like you can.
27) 
We've got kids here. Families.
28) LILLY
{NormalC}He is. He just {SadA}has his issues.
29) LEE
{NormalA}Nevermind, {HappyA}I'm sure he's a good guy.
30) 
Nevermind, I'm sure he's a good guy.
32) 
You're from here?
36) LEE
{ThinkingA}You're from here?
33) LEE
{NormalC}Yeah, I know it. {HappyA}Pilot?
34) LEE
{thinkingB}I work up at UGA.
35) LILLY
{HappyA}Nah, just mechanical admin stuff. {AngryA}I deal with a bunch of shitheads and bureaucrats all day. {HappyA}Sometimes a plane, if I'm lucky.
37) LILLY
{HappyA}You?
38) LILLY
{ThinkingA}I work at Warner Robbins. {NormalA}The Air Force base.
39) 
Was anyone here when you guys got the pharmacy?
40) LILLY
{SadA}No, this place was pretty wrecked. {DisgustA}We pulled a couple bodies out of the office.
41) LILLY
{ThinkingB}Are you ok?
42) LILLY
{SadB}I'm sorry. We found an older couple in the office. {FearA}Dad hauled them out in case they {SadA}weren't really dead.
43) LEE
[stressed] {SadC}Yeah, I'm fine.
44) LEE
{SadA}Yeah, the owners. They were... {FearA}{SadB}we were close.
45) LEE
{FearA}Was anyone here when you guys got here?{FearB}
46) LILLY
{ThinkingA}Did you know anybody here?
47) LILLY
{ThinkingB}Where's her mom?
48) LEE
{NormalA}Savannah, {ThinkingA}I think.
49) LILLY
{NormalB}Oh, {THinkingB}you guys aren't together?
50) LEE
[pickup1][pauses important ]{NormalD}Oh, no, {ThinkingA}I'm not her dad. {SadA}I found her in a house when getting out of Atlanta. She'd been surviving{SadB} by herself.
51) LEE
[pickup1] [quiet, intimate convo distance][pauses important] {FearA}I heard an answering message, they were in Savannah, {SadA}she was home with a sitter. {SadC}It wasn't good.
52) LEE
[quiet, intimate convo distance] {SadC}I think the girl's parents didn't make it.
53) LILLY
[intimate convo] {sadA}Well, {HappyA}she's lucky to have you.
54) LILLY
[intimate convo] {SadB}Oh.
55) 
When do you expect the military to handle this?
56) LILLY
{SadB}God, I don't know. {NormalC}I wasn't at work when dad and I headed here looking for help. {ThinkingB}They scrambled jets days ago. {FearA}And I don't see anything different.
57) LEE
{THinkingB}When's the military taking care of this?
58) LEE
{FearA}So you're saying the military may be trying or have {FearB}already tried?
59) LILLY
{SadB}Unfortunately, {SadA}yeah.
60) LEE
{normalD}What do you think about all this?
61) LILLY
{SadB}Well, I was pissed Glenn threw open that door but, {SadA}I'm glad you walked through it. {HappyA}You're a strong guy who seems like he can keep his head.
62) LILLY
[pickup1]{FearA}What is there to think? The dead are up, walking around, {AngryA}eating people and turning them into more... moreï¿½ of them. I mean, Jesus.
63) LEE
{ThinkingB}We need to stick together and get through this.
64) 
What do you think about all of this?
65) 
Exit
66) LILLY
{SadA}I'm gonna get back to him.
67) LEE
{SadA}Sounds good.
68) LILLY
[pickup1]{ThinkingA}It was a crazy situation and you froze. Before, {DisgustA}with that thing coming out of the bathroom, I've seen trained killers do the same.
69) LILLY
{normalC}Just, don't beat yourself up over it. {happyA}We stick together and we'll be ok.
70) LILLY
{NormalC}Oh, and Lee?
71) LEE
{SadB}Uh, yeah.
73) LEE
{ThinkingA}I'm on it.
74) LEE
{NormalB}Fair enough.
75) LILLY
{FearA}Hey, I should really just give him as much attention as I can.
76) LILLY
{ThinkingA}Try to find those keys, Lee. {SadB}He could get worse fast.
77) LEE
{HappyA}It's not much, but here.
78) LILLY
{ThinkingA}Are you sure?
79) LEE
{HappyA}Yeah. You're under quite a bit of stress.
80) LILLY
{ThinkingA}Thanks. That's uh... {happyA}really sweet.
81) LEE
{HappyA}Don't mention it.
82) LEE
[pickup1] Eh, the girl still got grabbed.
83) LILLY
[pickup1] Way to take care of things, before -- with the fight and those guys dicking around with that radio.
84) LILLY
[pickup1] You can't do everything.
92) LILLY
[pickup1] You can't do everything.
97) LILLY
[pickup1] You can't do everything.
85) LEE
[pickup1] It seems not.
91) LEE
[pickup1] It seems not.
96) LEE
[pickup1] It seems not.
86) LILLY
[pickup1] But stopping that fight was damn impressive. I couldn't have done it.
87) LEE
[pickup1] It didn't, but you're right. And Clementine still got grabbed by that thing in the bathroom.
88) LILLY
[pickup1] We just have to keep our eyes out better -- that radio could've gotten us all killed.
89) LILLY
[pickup1] I know my dad was... out of line, before but--
90) LEE
[pickup1] [cutting her off] Hey, whatever, forget about it.
93) LILLY
[pickup1] That fight with my dad and your guy was a shit-show.
94) LILLY
[pickup1] But you made sure that those guys didn't do something dumb with that radio.
95) LEE
[pickup1] Yeah, I saw where that was goin'.
98) LEE
[pickup1] Sure, but I should've been paying attention to the girl.
99) LEE
[pickup1] What makes you say that?
100) LILLY
[pickup1] This whole place just went to hell.  That little girl was in trouble.
101) LILLY
[pickup1] [a little sarcastic] You don't like to trouble yourself with much, hmm?
102) LILLY
[pickup1] Seems not.
103) LEE
[pickup1] You can't control everything, even if you try.
107) LEE
Also, BALLS.
108) LILLY
[pickup1] {angrya}{body-A}I was just doing what I had to earlier.
112) LILLY
[pickup1] {angrya}{body-A}I was just doing what I had to earlier.
109) LEE
[pickup1] {thinkingB}{body-B}Everyone was.
113) LEE
[pickup1] {thinkingB}{body-B}Everyone was.
110) LILLY
[pickup1] {thinkingA}You didn't have to call me {angryB}a bitch in front of my people.
111) LILLY
[pickup1] {angryC}I don't need that shit, all right? It's {sadA}hard enough to be in charge of people's lives {angryB}without some dick cutting you down.
114) LILLY
[pickup1] {sadB}Now his heart's acting up again, and {fearA}I'm powerless to do anything.
115) LILLY
[pickup1] {angryB}{body-a}And that violence before; with my dad -- that didn't help.
116) LILLY
[pickup1] {sadB}[quiet] Sure... I guess.
117) LILLY
[pickup1] {fearA}{body-a}And...[quiet] You should {sadA}know I didn't think he was in the right.
118) LEE
[pickup1] {disgustA}You didn't say anything. And Duck could've been bitten.
119) 
Talk to
120) 
Give Food to
121) LILLY
[pickup1][pissed] I'm gonna get back to him now.
