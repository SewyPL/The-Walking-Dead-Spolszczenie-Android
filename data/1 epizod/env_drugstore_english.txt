[pickup1][hushed, tense, angry]That is some cold shit.
724) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed, tense, angry] We can't stop helping people.
725) 
I understand.
726) 
That's nuts.
727) 
You're a cold bitch.
742) LEE
[pickup1] You're a cold bitch.
728) LEE
[pickup1][hushed, stern]I get that, but we can't turn on who's left.

757) LILLY
[pickup1]We can't trust anybody. We already know that.
758) LILLY
[pickup1] [angry]What's DANGEROUS is a bunch of people running outside and drawing their attention to us.
759) KENNY
[pickup1][angry] Lee's right. We're just regular folks, but WE actually like helping people.
760) LILLY
[pickup1] [angry, not too loud]Don't come in here and swear at me!
761) LEE
[pickup1] [angry]I'll say whatever I want if you start threatening these people.

763) LILLY
[pickup1][stern] The hell he, or ANYONE will.
764) CARLEY
[pickup1][stern] You'll have to excuse her.
765) GLENN
[pickup1] They've got kids, Lilly.
766) KENNY
[pickup1] [in an argument]Lee, can you believe this lady?
767) KENNY
[pickup1] [angry]Maybe you should go join 'em, then. You'll have something in common!
768) LILLY
[pickup1] Those things outside don't care.
769) 
She's an asshole.
770) 
She's not wrong.
771) 
She's the leader.
772) LEE
[pickup1] She's the leader here.
773) LEE
[pickup1] This is how somebody is not really in control acts though.
774) LILLY

[pickup1] [argument]She's not wrong. They took a risk.
777) LILLY
[pickup1] [argument]Yes we did.
778) LEE
[pickup1] [argument] She's an asshole, that's for sure.
779) LILLY
[pickup1] That's what it takes.
780) KENNY
[pickup1] [argument] I can see the resemblance. My son won't grow up to be a raging fucking lunatic, that's for certain.
781) LARRY
[pickup1] [argument] That lady's my daughter.
782) LARRY
[pickup1] [argument] Son?
787) 
It's him or Duck.
788) KENNY
[pickup1] [panicked, angry]Lee, what do we do about this guy?
789) 
Reason with him.

804) KENNY
[pickup1] [seething]That's what I'm thinking.
805) LEE
[pickup1] We kick his ass.
806) KENNY
[pickup1][argument] With or without you, I'm protecting my kid with my LIFE.
811) LARRY
[pickup1][angry]But right now we're about to be TRAPPED in here with one of those things.
812) LARRY
[pickup1][angry] He's bitten! That's how you TURN.
813) KATJAA
[pickup1][angry] He's not bitten!
814) KATJAA
[pickup1][angry] Lee, stop this! It's upsetting him!
815) KENNY
[pickup1][angry] What the hell are you talkin' about?
824) 
It's his SON.
825) 
Settle down, now.
826) 
If it was your girl?
827) 
Sit down, or else.
828) KENNY
[pickup1][argument]I'm gonna kill him, KAT. Just worry about Duck!
841) KENNY
[pickup1][argument]I'm gonna kill him, KAT. Just worry about Duck!
829) LARRY
[pickup1][argument] NEVER woulda' happened.
830) LARRY
[pickup1][argument] She's not some snot nosed toddler, ok? She's United States Air Force.
831) KENNY
[pickup1][argument] Oh fuck you AND her!
832) LEE
[pickup1][argument] What if this was your daughter?
833) LEE
[pickup1][argument] Sit down, or that's IT.
834) LARRY
[pickup1][argument] You gonna whoop me? You and what homo parade?
835) KENNY
[pickup1][argument] This one.
836) LARRY
[pickup1][argument] HA, that's good!
837) LARRY
[pickup1][argument] [over your shoulder] Little boy! Before you EAT your mommy, you can watch your dad get his nose broken.
838) LARRY
[pickup1][argument] Do you? You're not fucking acting like it!
839) LILLY
[pickup1][argument] Dad, we get it, it's a big deal.
840) LARRY
[pickup1][argument] Oh, I'm "upsetting" him? Upsetting is getting eaten alive!
842) LEE
[pickup1][across the room]Yeah?
843) CLEMENTINE
[pickup1][across the room, sort of hushed though] Lee?
844) LEE
[pickup1][dismissive, across the room] It's just locked. Key's behind the counter. Probably.
845) CLEMENTINE
[pickup1][across the room]There's someone in there.
846) KENNY
[pickup1][argument] No, you're just the guy arguing for killing a kid!
847) LARRY
[pickup1][argument] Hey, I'm not the bad guy here, I'm just looking out for my daughter!
848) LARRY
[pickup1][argument] He's covered in muck! She'll find the bite. WATCH.
849) KATJAA
[pickup1][argument] [from across the room]No! I'm cleaning him up! There's no bite! He's fine!
850) LARRY
[pickup1][argument] And if she DOES?
851) KENNY
[pickup1][argument] She won't.
852) LEE
[pickup1] But it looks it like she's losing control of her people.
853) KATJAA
[pickup1] KENNY! STOP HIM!
854) LARRY
[pickup1] He's covered in their blood! You'll find the bite. [cont,]
855) LARRY
[pickup1] We gotta throw him out! Or smash his head in!
856) KENNY
[pickup1] [seething]Shut up.
857) LARRY
[pickup1] Don't you fucking people get it? We've already SEEN this happen. We let someone with a bite stay and-and WE all end up bitten!
858) 
He's just a boy.
859) 
Deal with it.
860) 
We do what you say.
861) LEE
[pickup1] He's a little boy; I think we can handle him.
862) LARRY
[pickup1] A little boy?! He'll be an uncontrollable man eater!
863) KENNY
[pickup1] It's not gonna happen!
868) KENNY
[pickup1] It's not gonna happen!
864) LARRY
[pickup1] It is and we're tossing him out NOW!!!
867) LARRY
[pickup1] It is and we're tossing him out NOW!!!
865) LEE
[pickup1] Then we deal with it then. But right now we're just freaking everybody out.
866) LARRY
[pickup1] Then get ready to deal with it because that boy is BITTEN.
869) LEE
[pickup1]Then we do what you say. We toss him out and save the group.
870) KENNY
[pickup1] Lee?! What the fuck man?
871) LEE
[pickup1] What other choice is there?
872) LARRY
[pickup1] FINALLY. Someone gets some sense. But we can't wait - we are tossing him out NOW!!!
873) LARRY
[pickup1] The first thing he'll do is sink his teeth into his mom's face.
874) LARRY
[pickup1]Then once she's dead, he'll probably pounce on YOUR little girl.
875) LARRY
[pickup1] She'll turn fast and then they'll be three.
876) LARRY
[pickup1] And that, boy, is the ballgame.
877) LARRY
[pickup1] Which pretty much seals the deal for me. We're throwin' him out!
878) 
Hit him, Kenny. [Stop him]
880) 
You're right. [Let him.]
881) 
I'm sorry, Kenny. [Let him.]
882) KENNY
[pickup1] Happily.
883) LEE
[pickup1] Knock this guy out.
884) LEE
[pickup1][hyper aggressive] NO. You don't touch that boy, you don't TOUCH anybody.
885) LEE
[pickup1] [hyper aggressive] I've got a little girl I'm trying to protect in here too. You want to get violent you old fuck?! Well, COME ON. You better have a plan to kill me though, because it's ME before anyone else in here.
886) LEE
[pickup1] I'm sorry, Kenny. He's right. This is about survival.
891) LEE
[pickup1] I'm sorry, Kenny. He's right. This is about survival.
887) KENNY
[pickup1] [losing it] LEE?! This is my boy Lee! My boy! We can't!
889) KENNY
[pickup1] [losing it] LEE?! This is my boy Lee! My boy! We can't!
888) LEE
[pickup1] You're right, man. That boy is a time bomb.
