{normalC} A man asks you your name, you give it. {disgustA} Unless that name is no good.
2) HERSHEL
{angryA} You should know that if you weren't leaving with Kenny today, {disgustA} I wouldn't stand for your lack of honesty last night.
3) LEE
{thinkingB} I'm not sure I follow.
4) HERSHEL
{disgustA} How'd you get out of Atlanta?
5) LEE
{sadA} ...On foot. I headed south and {fearA}hoofed it out of there. [sets logic liar]
6) LEE
{normalD} ...I got a ride and then I was in a wreck. I walked until your boy found me.
7) LEE
{normalD} ...I was on my way out anyway. Timing of all this just happened to be right. [sets logic liar]
8) 
On foot.

13) HERSHEL
{thinkingA} That's a long walk.
14) HERSHEL
{thinkingA} Hmm. Well you're no worse for wear.
15) HERSHEL
{thinkingA} Ha, if there ever is a good time for the supposed "apocalypse."
16) HERSHEL
[incredulous] {thinkingA} Well, I'm sure it was complicated.
70) HERSHEL
[incredulous] {thinkingA} Well, I'm sure it was complicated.
17) LEE
{thinkingA} Was brought up to, yes.
18) LEE
[trying to change the subject] {fearA}{body-C} This {happyB}farm's a nice plot of land.
19) HERSHEL
{sadA} Never was the plan, having a place like this. It was in the family, and I guess so was I. {happyA} Family's important; it's all that matters. {thinkingA}You agree with that?
20) HERSHEL
{thinkingA} Where's your family now? Parents? Wife? Girlfriend?
21) HERSHEL
{thinkingA} Heh, had you told me twenty years ago I'd be still be doing this,{happyA} I would told you that you were full of crap.
22) LEE
{normalD} My parents are in Macon, with my brother.
23) LEE
{normalD} No wife, not anymore. I think she's up in Virginia, maybe.
24) LEE
{normalD} No family. {happyA}I had a beta fish on my desk at the University.
26) 
My parents are in Macon.
27) 
No wife anymore.
28) 
No family.
30) HERSHEL
{happyA} Well I hope they're all right.
31) HERSHEL
{sadA} Sorry to hear it.
32) HERSHEL
{sadA} I hope someone remembered to feed him.
33) HERSHEL
{angryA} Fine. Keep your mouth shut. {disgustA} Rude as hell, but what's a man to do.
71) HERSHEL
{angryA} Fine. Keep your mouth shut. {disgustA} Rude as hell, but what's a man to do.
34) HERSHEL
{sadA}{body-D} But now you've got this little girl to take care of.{body-handships} Clementine, is it? {thinkingA}You just stumbled up-on her?
36) LEE
{normalC}{body-A} Yeah, I was looking for help in her house.
37) LEE
{normalC}{body-A} I was being attacked and she came to my rescue.
38) LEE
{thinkingA}{body-A} What are you getting at?
39) 
I was looking for help in her house.
40) 
I was being attacked and she came to my rescue.
41) 
What are you getting at?
42) HERSHEL
[judgmental, distrusting] {disgustA} Hmmph. [like, is that so]
43) HERSHEL
{angryA} Can I give you a piece of advice?
44) LEE
{normalB} Sure.
47) 
Sure.
45) LEE
{angryA}{body-C} What is it.
46) LEE
{angryB}{body-C} Mind your own business.
48) 
What is it?
49) 
Mind your own business.
51) HERSHEL
{normalC}{body-D} I don't know who you are or what you did.
52) HERSHEL
{thinkingA}{body-D} But you better become a better liar, and fast.
53) HERSHEL
{thinkingA} But you better figure out your story. Or at least what you want your story to be.
54) HERSHEL
{fearA} Let's say things don't get better back in the cities. {normalB} Or they get worse before they do. {thinkingA} You're going to have to depend on the honesty of strangers if you're going to make it. {sadA} And if those same people get to questioning yours, you're going to be in trouble.
67) HERSHEL
{fearA} Let's say things don't get better back in the cities. {normalB} Or they get worse before they do. {thinkingA} You're going to have to depend on the honesty of strangers if you're going to make it. {sadA} And if those same people get to questioning yours, you're going to be in trouble.

55) HERSHEL
{disgustA} So whoever you are, and whatever you did, keep it to your damn self.
68) HERSHEL
{disgustA} So whoever you are, and whatever you did, keep it to your damn self.
56) HERSHEL
[a hmmph, kind of to yourself] {happyA} But at least you have the common sense to listen to a man giving you advice.
57) HERSHEL
{fearA} Oh, and {angryA}I'd start checking the attitude, friend.
58) HERSHEL
{sadA} Oh, and {angryA}trying to be less of an asshole would serve you just fine.
59) HERSHEL
{angryA} And another thing: {thinkingA} you're going to have to figure out how to answer a goddamn question when someone asks.
60) HERSHEL
{surprisedA} GO! I'll get my gun.
61) SHAWN
[super far away scream] SHIT THEY'RE HERE! [gets leg trapped] AHH! HELP!
62) CLEMENTINE
[SCREAM!] AHHHHHH!
63) LEE
{fearC} What the?!--
64) HERSHEL
[pickup1] And honestly, I don't even want to know.
65) HERSHEL
[pickup1] {disgustA} I ain't dumb. I caught you in that lie last night; about who were with in that car.
66) HERSHEL
[pickup1] HMMPH. [pissed]
72) HERSHEL
[pickup1] HMMPH. [pissed]
