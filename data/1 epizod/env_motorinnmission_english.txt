1) LEE
[pickup1] [hushed, sharp] Cover me.
2) LEE
[pickup1][hushed] Probably shouldn't go that way.
3) LEE
[pickup1][hushed] That way's not safe.
4) LEE
[pickup1][hushed] Carley, stay here.
5) LEE
[pickup1][hushed] Glenn, stay here.
6) LEE
[pickup1][hushed] Glenn, let's go. [running to a new station - quick and fast]

265) GLENN
[pickup1] And here, check this out.
266) GLENN
[pickup1] Batteries or something could be useful.
267) LEE
[pickup1] How is that supposed to help?...
268) GLENN
[pickup1] And here!
269) GLENN
[pickup1] I found it and thought the batteries or something could prove useful.
279) LEE
[pickup1] I'll wait for him to get closer...
280) LEE
[pickup1] Wait for it...
281) GLENN
[pickup1] Bad idea, dude. Let's get out of here.
282) GLENN
[pickup1] Bad idea. We can do better than that thing.
298) GLENN
[pickup1]No!
475) CARLEY
[pickup1] NO.
299) GLENN
[pickup1] What are you doing?! NO!
300) LEE
[pickup1] GLENN.
301) LEE
[pickup1][stern, holding a guy back] Leave her alone, Glenn.
302) GLENN
[pickup1]NO! Come on!!!
303) LEE
[pickup1]...you  need to think this through...
304) LEE
[pickup1][ramping up intensity]...we'll find you a doctor, it'll be ok, let's all just...
305) LEE
[pickup1]  Miss, just relax now...
306) LEE
[pickup1] [sarcastic] It was her idea.
307) LEE
[hushed][pickup1]Get your gun ready.
308) LEE
[pickup1][hushed]Be ready to shoot.
337) LEE
[pickup1][hushed]Be ready to shoot.
309) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed][SUPER relieved] GUYS! Oh man, I'm glad you're here.
310) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed]LISTEN. I was out here looking for gas. [continual sentence]
311) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] And then, up there in the corner room, I heard crying coming from inside.
312) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] It's a girl. We talked and she got frightened. I was trying to get in and help her and she started yelling and saying I was bitten.
313) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed]I tried to convince her I wasn't and that's when all of these guys came out of the forest. A couple almost got me and I ended up hiding in the ice machine.
314) 
Push
315) LEE
[pickup1] Why don't you guys lag behind; just in case this goes to hell.
316) CARLEY
[pickup1] Ok. We'll be right behind you.
317) LEE
[pickup1][seen by zombie] Shit!
318) LEE
[pickup1][seen by zombie] Shit! That guy saw me.
319) LEE
[pickup1][seen by zombie] Dammit!
320) LEE
[pickup1][seen by zombie] Fuck! I think he saw me!
321) LEE
[pickup2][whispering]Looks like that guy was doing some uh, cranking.
322) GLENN
[pickup2]You mean wrenching. You should hold onto that, could come in handy.
323) LEE
[pickup2][quiet]Looks like that guy was doing some uh, cranking.
324) GLENN
[pickup2][quiet] Sparkplug. [emph plug]You should hold onto that, could come in handy.
325) GLENN
[pickup2][hushed]The porcelain inside these things turns car windows to tissue paper.
332) GLENN
[pickup2][hushed]The porcelain inside these things turns car windows to tissue paper.
326) GLENN
[pickup2][hushed]You picked up that sparkplug to shatter that window, right?
327) GLENN
[pickup2][hushed]All right dude, let's see those ninja rocks.
328) LEE
[pickup2][hushed]What the hell are you talking about?
329) GLENN
[pickup2][hushed]Let me see the sparkplug.
333) GLENN
[pickup2][hushed]Let me see the sparkplug.
330) LEE
[pickup2][hushed]Ninja what now?
331) GLENN
Wait-
334) LEE
[pickup2][hushed] There's a pick in the truck.
335) LEE
[pickup2][hushed] I wonder if there's anything in the pickup.
336) LEE
[pickup2][hushed] It's locked.
344) LEE
[pickup2] [phew]...
345) CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] Jesus, Glenn!
346) LEE
[pickup2][hushed] All right, that wasn't so hard. [to find your friend]
348) LEE
[pickup2][hushed] Who is it?
350) CARLEY
[pickup1] No way, we gotta go. NOW.
353) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] I'm saving her, with or without you.
354) LEE
[pickup2][hushed] Damn right we can't.
355) LEE
[pickup2][hushed] Think about if it was you.
356) CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] You guys are suicidal. Over a girl!
357) CARLEY
[pickup1] [hushed] Fine. Let's go save Glenn's damsel in distress.
358) LEE
[pickup2][hushed] QUIETLY. Noise attracts these things. Now let's have a look around.
359) LEE
[pickup2][hushed] Ok, this is the plan. We don't know how hard it's going to be to get her out of that room.
360) LEE
[pickup2][hushed] So we have to kill every one of them in here.
361) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] Yeah, it's boarded up.
362) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] Oh man. She's eating something. So we got that one right there, close.
363) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] There's one back there, trying to get into a room, but I didn't see anyone actually in there.
364) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] The girl's behind that door -- those two seem to be on the scent.
365) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] I saw one lurking on the other side of that car.
366) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed]That's everything I know, man. But, you know, watch out.
367) LEE
[pickup2][hushed] Let's head back to that wall. Safe there.
368) LEE
[pickup2][hushed] We can hide by that RV if we're quiet and keep our heads down.
369) LEE
[pickup2][hushed] There's a car up on ramps.
370) LEE
[pickup2][hushed] We can hide by that pickup.
371) LEE
[pickup2][hushed] We can head over there but we'll have to take care of that guy first.
372) LEE
[pickup2][hushed] We can head over there but we'll have to take care of that guy first.
373) LEE
[pickup2][hushed]We can go over there when the rest of these down here are taken care of.
374) LEE
[pickup2] [hushed] We're doing this. No question.
375) LEE
[pickup2][hushed] Take this. It's not much, but better for you to be armed with something.
376) LEE
[pickup2][hushed] Maybe Doug's got a use for this.

412) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] Take a peek over the wall.
413) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] We can probably make it over to the RV or down to the truck if we're quick and quiet about it.
414) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] If we're going to kill all these guys we're going to have to sneak around.
415) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] I wouldn't say no to something I could use for protection.
416) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] She's still trapped up there. Let's get these guys down here taken care of!
417) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] We should keep looking around for weapons.
418) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] The longer you're unarmed the more nervous I get.
419) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] Let's go check out that truck under the awning.
420) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] Now let's clear out the area around the RV.
436) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] Now let's clear out the area around the RV.
421) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] We're a little naked out here, except for Carley's gun and we can't use that much.
422) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] We're going to need weapons.
423) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] You've got that pick, but I could really use something.
424) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] [man,]I hope that girl's ok...
426) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] [man,]I hope that girl's ok...
425) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] I think you're going to need more than your fists, man.
427) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] Let's keep looking around.
428) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] She's right above us, guys.
429) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] Let's start taking these guys out.
430) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] I'm worried about the girl upstairs.
431) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] Their groaning attracts the others.
432) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] Carley, you don't have a silencer for your sidearm, huh?
433) CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] Those are illegal, Glenn.
434) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] Just a thought.
435) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] That one sitting down is just as dangerous as the others.
437) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] You have to be careful with your ride up on ramps like this.
438) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] Safety first, I guess.
439) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] We can get that guy by the wall over there, I bet...
440) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] Kill him, Lee -- before he attracts the others!
441) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] You need another weapon, man.
442) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] Be careful dealing with the two upstairs.
443) CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] What do you see up there?
444) CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] If I have to use this,[her gun] we're in trouble.
445) CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] Where to next?
446) CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] I'll cover you if you sneak over to the RV.
447) CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] This is suicide...
448) CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] We need to kill these things as quickly as possible...
449) CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] There's a truck over there. Maybe we can find you a weapon.
450) CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] Want to head over to the right?
451) CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] Let's get the ones over there, head upstairs, and get out of here.
460) CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] Let's get the ones over there, head upstairs, and get out of here.
464) CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] Let's get the ones over there, head upstairs, and get out of here.
452) CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] Let's keep moving.
453) CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] You need to find a weapon.
454) CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] Be careful getting up close to these guys; I can't always cover you.
455) CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] Ready to move?
456) CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] How are you going to kill that one by the car without attracting the others?
457) CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] Trying to shoot that guy from here is probably a bad idea, huh?
458) CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] I love this gun, but it sure isn't quiet.
459) CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] Find a way to kill that guy before he alerts the others, ok?
461) CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] I don't like being out in the open like this.
462) CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] I'd prefer cover that can't just roll away.
465) CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] I'd prefer cover that can't just roll away.
463) CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed]
466) CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] Quick! Before he attracts more!
467) CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] Uh, Lee, weapon?
468) CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] We'll try to have your back, but this gun's a liability.
469) GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] The moment we head towards that car, he's going to unleash enough noise to totally screw us.

476) 
Do it!
477) 
Then shoot her.
489) LEE
[pickup3] Then shoot her.
478) 
We can't take the risk of her alive.
479) 
Look at her. Please give it to her.
480) LEE
[pickup3][angry,big] DO IT.
481) CARLEY
[pickup1] FINE. You're all fucking crazy.
482) LEE
[pickup3] Look at her, Carley. There's no happy ending to this.
483) MOTEL GIRL
[pickup1] I've seen what hell is like, and it's coming back as one of those things.

484) LEE
[pickup3] She could turn right now. We can't take a risk. Hand it over to her.
485) CARLEY
[pickup1] [relenting] God, just...ok. Fine.
486) CARLEY
[pickup1] You're insane! Just take this thing.
487) CARLEY
[pickup1] HUH?!
488) LEE
[pickup3] SHOOT HER. Help her out, here.
490) CARLEY
[pickup1] [relenting, sad] Ok, fine.
491) LEE
[pickup3] Because somebody needs to pick up the gun. We can't leave it. You two go on.
528) LEE
[pickup3] Because somebody needs to pick up the gun. We can't leave it. You two go on.
492) CARLEY

510) CARLEY
[pickup1] Look, I'll just walk over there and blow him away, and hope it's not too loud.
511) LEE
[pickup3] Ha, yeah right. I'll try to find some way to muffle your shot.
512) LEE
[pickup3] Oh shit! That thing got a look at me.
513) LEE
[pickup3] Shit, I think it saw me.
514) LEE
[pickup3] Oh man, it might've seen me.
515) LEE
