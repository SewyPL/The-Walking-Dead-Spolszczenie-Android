Do you know the combination to the lock outside?
70) GLENN

78) LEE
[pickup3] I know I did.
79) GLENN
[pickup2] You let her do it, you know. You said give her the gun.
80) GLENN
[pickup2] Why didn't you tell Carley to just give it to her?
81) LEE
[pickup3] [sad, agreeing]Seems like.
82) GLENN
[pickup2] I guess she really wanted that gun...

94) GLENN
[pickup2] I...I guess.
95) LEE
[pickup3] She didn't WANT to live. She would've found a way to end it.
96) LEE
[pickup3] You can't make someone fight. We gave her the least painful option.

107) LEE
[pickup3] It would've been a waste of a bullet.
108) LEE
[pickup3] She's gone now anyway.
109) GLENN
[pickup2] Whoa, man. She was a person.
110) LEE
[pickup3] She was dead anyway. I'm not in the euthanasia business.
111) GLENN
[pickup2] [confused] What do you mean?
112) GLENN
[pickup2] [response to silence from player]Well... I'm glad you didn't. Really.
