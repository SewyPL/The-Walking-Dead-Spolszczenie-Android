1) LEE
{happyA}	This was my dad's cane. He'd zip around here on it from time to time.
2) CLEMENTINE
{sadA}	Was he sick?
3) CLEMENTINE
{thinkingA}What's that?
101) CLEMENTINE
What's that?
4) CLEMENTINE
{happyB}	My dad gave it to me.
5) LEE
{happyC}See, Dad's are smart like that.
6) LEE
{happyC}Plus he knew how to make it look cool. Like you, with your hat.
7) LEE
{happyB}Nah, he was ok. I actually saw him whoop shoplifters with it. This cane's protected this place better than any guard dog ever could.
8) LEE
[to himself] {sadA}I can't... {thinkingA}I can't think about them in here.
9) LEE
[to himself]{thinkingA} My parents came in here hoping to survive...{fearA} but it looks like one of them was hurt. I wonder if it was my dad. Trying to be a hero, maybe. {sadA}Or protect her, at least.
10) LEE
{normalB}	Luckily there's nothing I need in here.
11) LEE
{happyC}There's a band-aid in there, I bet.
12) CLEMENTINE
{happyB}	Oh, good.
13) LEE
{normalB}A First Aid Kit.
14) LEE
{happyB}Want to head back into the drugstore with me?

{fearA}	Lee?
17) CLEMENTINE
{fearB}You're not bad, right?
18) LEE
[like, 'yeah, what is it?'] Yeah?
70) CLEMENTINE
Yeah...
19) CLEMENTINE
{fearB}	That lady said you killed someone.{sadA} Was that because he was one of the things trying to eat you?
20) LEE
{surpriseA}I...{normalD}why are you asking me that?
21) 
No, he wasn't.
22) 
It's complicated.
23) 
Yeah, he was.
26) LEE
{normalD}Yeah, he was.
24) LEE
{normalD}	No. He wasn't. [the guy you killed wasn't a zombie]
25) LEE
{normalC}	It's complicated. Sometimes things happen or... {normalD}you do things and you can't explain them.
27) LEE
[was he a bad guy?] {angryB}He was.
28) CLEMENTINE
[distrusting] {fearB}Was he bad?
29) CLEMENTINE
[small, timid]{sadA} Oh.

38) LEE
{normalB}	Yeah?
125) CLEMENTINE
{sadA}	Yeah.
39) CLEMENTINE
{fearA}What if my parents come home and I'm not there?
40) LEE
{surpriseA}They'll uhh... track us down. {thinkingA}Don't worry.
41) LEE
{thinkingA}I don't think they will.
43) 
I don't think they will.
42) 
They'll find us.
44) CLEMENTINE
{sadA}Yeah. Ok. {thinkingA}We should keep a look out.
45) LEE
{happyA}They want you to be safe. {happyB}We'll find them if we can.
46) CLEMENTINE
I've got my walkie-talkie in case they try that way.
202) CLEMENTINE
[pickup1]I've got my walkie-talkie in case they try that way.
48) CLEMENTINE
[waiting for an answer] {angryA}I asked you a question...
49) LEE
{thinkingA}	I ought to clear a path to opening that door.
50) LEE
{normalC}	We better stay at it.
51) LEE
[referring to his dad] {thinkingA}I wonder how many nights he spent at this desk. {sadA}Thousands.
52) CLEMENTINE

57)

62) 
You don't need anything, right?
63) LEE
{thinkingA}You don't need anything, right?
64) CLEMENTINE
{sadA}It's not good.
65) LEE
{thinkingA}	No, it's not.
66) CLEMENTINE
But I think it'll be ok.
67) CLEMENTINE
{happyB}Yeah. It's not that heavy.
68) LEE
How about with everything outside.
69) LEE
{sadA}	Neither do I, Clementine. {thinkingA}Nobody does, I don't think.
71) CLEMENTINE
{thinkingA}I bet my dad does.
72) CLEMENTINE
{sadA}It's not good. {fearA}I don't know why everyone is crazy.
73) LEE
{thinkingB}But you're cool?{happyA}
74) LEE
{happyA}	Ok, good to know. And you don't have any allergies or anything I should know about, right?{thinkingA} Don't kids have allergies or asthma or just general maladies?

102) CLEMENTINE
[digesting] Oh. {happyB}Neat!
103) LEE
{happyB}	I like football and I play squash with a buddy of mine.
104) CLEMENTINE
{thinkingA}I play soccer, but I don't really like it.
