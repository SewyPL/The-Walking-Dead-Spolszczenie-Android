5) LEE
{SurpriseA}To Atlanta?
6) GLENN
Yeah... I got friends there, and{ThinkingA} I just can't stay here knowing that they could be trapped in that city.
7) LEE
{ThinkingA} It sounds like nobody knows what's happening there. {NormalC} When we left a few days ago it could've gone either way.
8) GLENN
{NormalB}I got to take my chances.
9) <<ID
{269A4908-84ED-44B1-B2DC-3A55670A2A5E}>>
10) LEE
{ThinkingA} I think you're making the wrong call.
11) LEE
{NormalD}You gotta do what you gotta do.
14) 
You gotta do what you gotta do.
12) LEE
{HappyA}Find your friends and be safe.
13) 
I think that's the wrong call.
15) 
Find your friends.
16) LEE
{NormalC}I respect that.
18) LEE
I respect that.
20) LEE
{NormalC}I respect that.
17) GLENN
{NormalC}Maybe. But I'd rather make the wrong call and know, than make{ThinkingA} the right call and not.
19) GLENN
{FearA} And I gotta do this.
21) GLENN
{HappyA}Thanks Lee, that means a lot. {SadA}I don't mean to abandon you all, but {NormalC}this seems like an okay setup, and I'm sure things will be back to normal around here in no time.
22) LEE
{ThinkingA}Let's hope.
23) GLENN
Well, be well and stay safe. And...some sort of good ending line based on the rad additions I make to Glenn's character.
24) LARRY
{NormalC}Lee, come here for a second.
25) LEE
{AngryA} What do you want?
26) LARRY
{DisgustA} You like my daughter?
27) LEE
{SurpriseA}Yeah, she's great.
31) 
Yeah, she's great.
28) LEE
{AngryC}Her dad tried to kill me, {DisgustA}so.
29) LEE
{NormalB}Not really.
34) 
Not really.
30) LEE
{ThinkingA}She's fine.
33) 
She's fine.
32) 
Her dad tried to kill me, so...
35) LARRY
{AngryA}Well stay the {AngryC}fuck away from her.
36) LEE
{DisgustA}Or what?
37) LARRY
Or everyone here knows that Lee Everett is a murderer.
38) LARRY
{DisgustA}Or, uh, {AngryA}everyone will know that you, Lee Everett are {AngryB}a killer. {AngryA} And you were before it was something you had to do to stay alive.
50) LARRY
{DisgustA}Or, uh, {AngryA}everyone will know that you, Lee Everett are {AngryB}a killer. {AngryA} And you were before it was something you had to do to stay alive.
39) LARRY
[angry] {AngryC}Fine, huh. {AngryB}Well just fuck you, Lee Everett.
40) LARRY
{HappyB}That's right. {AngryA}I know who you are and{AngryB} I know you're a killer. And you go near my daughter or{AngryC} step out of line ONCE and {DisgustA}so will everyone else.
41) LARRY
{HappyA}Good. {AngryB}Stay away from her; or {AngryA}everyone here knows that{DisgustA} Lee Everett is a killer. {AngryB}And I'm not talking about those THINGS out there.
42) LARRY
{HappyA}Then again, I wouldn't expect a {DisgustA}convicted murderer to listen to anything anybody's got to say.
43) LARRY
{DisgustA}You hear me?
47) LARRY
{DisgustA} You hear me?
44) LARRY
{AngryB}I asked you a question, boy.
45) LARRY
{DisgustA}I know who you are.
46) LARRY
{AngryC}And I don't give a shit about what {DisgustA}happens to you. {AngryC} But if anything happens to my daughter or that little girl you've got with you,{DisgustA} heh, you watch your ass.
48) LARRY
{AngryA}Well he did that because he knows that Lee Everett is a {AngryB}convicted murderer; {AngryA}and so will everyone else if you go near her.
49) LARRY
Well the answer better be "no."
51) LILLY
{body-HoldWrist}{HappyC} {body-B}My dad would be dead if it weren't for you.
52) LEE
{ThinkingB} {body-C2}That reporter is dead because of me.
53) LEE
{ThinkingB} {body-C2}That guy, Doug, is dead because of me.
54) LILLY
{NormalC} You can't be like that. You're only one man.
55) LILLY
{HappyC} We're lucky to have you.
56) KENNY
{body-A}{HappyB}I hope that's the sound of us winning this thing.
57) LEE
{ThinkingB} {body-C2}I don't know...
58) KENNY
{HappyB} We've got beds, we've got water and most importantly, {body-B}{HappyA}we've got light.  {ThinkingA} There are worse places to call home.
59) LILLY
{body-HandOnHip}{HappyB} I actually agree with that plan.
60) LILLY
{HappyA}Yeah. You're right. {body-A}{HappyC}You know guys, I think it's going to be ok.
61) KENNY
{ThinkingA} This motor inn's pretty damn defendable. {body-HandsHips}We block off the entrances with some cars and keep someone on watch and we could {HappyA}stay here until the military rolls through.
62) LILLY
{HappyA} Me too.
63) LEE
{HappyA}Me too.
64) LEE
It might be a good idea to go check on Doug.
65) DOUG
{NormalC}I...I know it's stupid, we just met...{ThinkingA}it's dumb, but uhï¿½ I mean it's...it's...{NormalA} probably just that survivor thing, {SadB}but I really liked her.
66) DOUG
{SadA}{body-B}We couldn't save her, could we?
67) LEE
{NormalD}How are you doing, Doug?
68) LEE
{NormalC} I don't think so. It happened pretty fast.
104) LEE
{ThinkingA}I don't think so. It happened pretty fast.
69) LEE
{SurpriseA}Doug?
70) LEE
{HappyA}She liked you too.
73) 
She liked you too.
71) LEE
{NormalD}I'm sorry, Doug.
72) LEE
{NormalC}You'll be all right.
75) 
You'll be all right.
108) LEE
{NormalC}You'll be all right.
111) 
You'll be all right.
74) 
I'm sorry.
76) DOUG
{HappyA}Thanks, Lee.
77) DOUG
{SadA}It's ok. {NormalC}Thanks, though.
78) DOUG
[doesn't believe him] {NormalA}Yeah, {SadA}I know.
79) DOUG
{SadA}Sorry, it's dumb.
80) DOUG
How did you choose? {SadA}I mean, we both needed you... you picked me.
81) LEE
I understand.
116) LEE
{NormalC} I understand.
82) LEE
What is it, buddy?
83) DOUG
{FearA} Wait, {NormalC}Lee?
84) DOUG
{NormalA}Anyway, I'd rather be alone, I think.
115) CARLEY
{ThinkingB}Anyway, I'd rather be alone I think.
85) LEE
{NormalC}I didn't.
88) 
I didn't.
120) LEE
{NormalC} I didn't.
123) 
I didn't.
86) LEE
{NormalB}I thought you needed help.
87) LEE
{NormalD}I was going to help you both..
90) 
I was going to help you both.
122) LEE
{NormalD} I was going to help you both.
125) 
I was going to help you both.
89) 
It looked like you needed help.
91) LEE
{NormalB}Sometimes we don't make choices. {NormalC}We just do what we do.
127) LEE
{NormalB}Sometimes we don't make choices. {NormalC}We just do what we do.
92) DOUG
{SadA}Oh.
339) LEE
Oh...
93) LEE
But it wasn't a choice, like that. {ThinkingA}It was... {NormalC} just something I did. {NormalB} I don't know why.
129) LEE
But it wasn't a choice, like that. {ThinkingA}It was... {NormalC} just something I did. {NormalB} I don't know why.
94) DOUG
{NormalC}Oh, I guess that makes sense.
95) DOUG
{NormalB}That makes sense, I guess. {NormalC} But you helped me first.
96) LEE
{NormalC}Yeah, I did.
130) LEE
{NormalC}Yeah, I did.
97) DOUG
{SadA}I guess it doesn't matter.
132) CARLEY
{ThinkingA} I guess it doesn't matter.
98) DOUG
{SadB}I just wish you would've picked her.
99) LEE
It might be a good idea to go check on Carley.
100) LEE
{NormalC} I do, yeah. [I'm ok, you know, considering...]
101) CARLEY
{NormalA} I'm ok. {SadA}You know, considering.
102) CARLEY
I can't stop thinking about Doug. {ThinkingA}We couldn't have saved him, could we?
103) CARLEY
{FearA} I know it's stupid...we'd just met... {ThinkingB}and he was such a...it's just that...{DisgustA} I think that I liked him.
105) LEE
{NormalD}How are you doing, Carley?
106) LEE
[lighthearted] {HappyA}Well I'm sure he liked you too.
109) 
Well I'm SURE he liked you too.
107) LEE
{SadA}I'm sorry, Car.
110) 
I'm sorry, Carley.
112) CARLEY
[trying to make light of a tragic situation] {HappyC}Ha, he BETTER have.
113) CARLEY
{SadA}It's ok. {HappyA}Thanks though.  {ThinkingA}There's been a lot of death in the past few days.
114) CARLEY
{NormalB}Yeah. {ThinkingA}Definitely.
117) CARLEY
{FearA}Wait, Lee?
118) LEE
{ThinkingA}What is it?
119) CARLEY
{ThinkingA}How did you choose? We both needed you... {DisgustA}you picked me.
121) LEE
{NormalB}I thought you needed the help.
124) 
I thought you needed the help.
126) CARLEY
{ThinkingB}Ah. [asked a question, got a benign answer]
128) CARLEY
{NormalC} Ah, that makes sense.
131) CARLEY
{ThinkingA} But you helped me first.
133) LEE
[heavy]{SadA} Me too, Carley.
134) CARLEY
I just wish we both could've made it, you know?
135) LEE
{HappyA}Yeah, we do.
136) KENNY
{body-HandsHips} {HappyA}We have to take care of each other. [remembering that he let Hershel's son die]
137) KENNY
{NormalC} No problem.
138) KENNY
{body-B}{FearA}Close call back there.
139) LEE
{body-C}Thanks for picking me up.
140) LEE
{body-A}{NormalA}Hey Ken.
141) LEE
{body-B} {HappyB}Thanks, Kenny.
142) LEE
{HappyA}{body-A}I did, yeah.
143) LEE
{NormalD}{body-C2}Yeah, I know that.
144) KENNY
{NormalB}{body-B}You said you wanted kids once.
145) KENNY
Well, {body-B}she's not your {NormalC}daughter so you can't treat her like she is.
146) KENNY
But you {NormalB}can take care of her. {body-A}Hell, {HappyB}maybe better than a father even could.
147) KENNY
{HappyA}I got your back, pal.
148) KENNY
{SadA}{body-A}You think that's gonna happen?
149) LEE
{body-C}{HappyA}Thanks Kenny
150) LEE
{ThinkingB}{body-C} Her parents showing up? {SadA}{body-C2}No, I don't.
151) LEE
{NormalB}Yeah, you did.
152) KENNY
{NormalC}Well I want you to know that I think you've got it in you.{body-HandsHips} I {ThinkingA}think you can take care of that little girl just fine.
153) KENNY
{NormalB}{body-B}Earlier, I mentioned you gotta ask yourself what you're gonna do if Clementine's parents don't show.
154) KENNY
{HappyB}You got it.
159) KENNY
You got it.
164) KENNY
You got it.
155) LEE
{body-A}{HappyB}Shit man, {body-B}{ThinkingA}do any of us?
156) LEE
{HappyA}Thanks, Kenny.
161) LEE
{HappyA}Thanks, Kenny.
157) KENNY
{body-HandsHips}{ThinkingA}I think you know what you're doing.
158) KENNY
{NormalC}With Clementine, I mean. {NormalB} {body-A}Earlier, you said you were clueless. I just want you to know that I {ThinkingA}look at you, and I see the type of guy who {HappyA}figures things out. {HappyB}{body-B}That girl is going to be just fine.
160) KENNY
{NormalC}{body-A}Hey, about Clementine.
162) KENNY
{NormalB}Earlier I said there's some stuff out there that might screw up a {ThinkingA}precious little girl like her.
163) LEE
You did.
165) KENNY
{NormalC} Well I still think that's true. But after {ThinkingA}what I saw today, I think, between you {HappyA}taking care of her and her taking care of herself, {HappyB} {body-B}you two are going to be just fine.
166) LEE
{NormalC}{body-B}Yeah?
167) LEE
[quiet!] Shit! Get down!
168) CARLEY
[catching your breath, but quiet, there are zombies around] Where is he?
169) LEE
[catching your breath, but quiet, there are zombies around] I'm not sure... he would've called for help, right?
170) CARLEY
[keeping quiet, zombies around] What? If he was being attacked? I'd think so...
171) CARLEY
[hushed] What do we do? Throw open the lid and start shooting? Yank whatever that is out and kill it?
172) LEE
[hushed, tense] Sure did.
173) CARLEY
[hushed] Did you see that?
174) LEE
[hushed] Let me have a look!
175) LEE
[hushed] Whatever it is, we can kill it quietly.
176) LEE
[hushed] I'll throw open the lid, you be ready to shoot.
177) CARLEY
[hushed] That's going to be loud.
178) LEE
[hushed] Then we deal with it.
179) LEE
[hushed] We're yanking whatever it is out of there.
180) LEE
[Hushed] Let's just have a look, be ready to run.
181) LEE
[hushed] One...two...
182) LEE
[hushed] One...two...
183) LEE
[hushed] One...two...
184) GLENN
[hushed] GUYS! Oh man, I'm glad you're here.
185) CARLEY
[hushed, surprised] Jesus, Glenn!
191) CARLEY
[hushed, surprised] Jesus, Glenn!
194) CARLEY
[hushed, surprised] Jesus, Glenn!
186) LEE
[hushed] Carley was going to shoot you.
187) GLENN
[hushed] Huh?! [carley was going to shoot you]
188) CARLEY
[hushed]Glenn! What are you doing in there?!
189) LEE
[hushed] Her idea. [jokingly passng the blame]
190) CARLEY
Lee was about to bash your brains in!
192) LEE
[hushed] We were about to rough you up.
193) GLENN
[hushed] I'm glad you didn't.
195) LEE
[hushed] What's up.
196) CARLEY
[hushed] No shit? You scared the hell out of us.
197) GLENN
[hushed] Just been hiding.
198) GLENN
[hushed] Hey, guys.
199) LEE
[hushed] Same.
200) CARLEY
[hushed] Can we get out of here before any of these things notice us?
201) GLENN
[hushed] Not yet. There's a survivor trapped up there.
202) GLENN
[hushed] I was out here looking for gas and, y'know I thought it might be a good idea to get some pillows and stuff for the group. Creature comforts, you know?
203) GLENN
[hushed] We talked and, well, then she got scared. I was trying to get in to help her, and then she started yelling and saying I was bitten. I tried to convince her I wasn't and that's when all of our friends showed up. A couple almost got me and I ended up hiding in there.
204) GLENN
[hushed] Anyway, I was going room to room and when I got to that one, up there on the corner, I heard crying on the other side of the door.
205) CARLEY
[hushed] Lucky you; now let's go!
206) GLENN
[hushed] We can't just leave her.
207) CARLEY
[hushed] Why not?
208) LEE
Glenn's right, we've got to help.
209) LEE
[hushed] You're right, Carley. Every second we spend out here, we're taking a chance.
210) LEE
[hushed] We should at least look around for a minute.
211) CARLEY
[hushed] Ugh, fine. We can try to rescue the girl, but she better be a sweetheart. You all right with that, Lee?
212) LEE
[hushed Yeah, I'm in.
213) GLENN
[hushed] But she's just in there, alone.
214) LEE
[hushed] It's not worth it, Glenn. She's safe, they can't get to her.
215) CARLEY
[hushed] Let's go, guys.
239) CARLEY
Let's go, guys.
216) GLENN
[hushed] We're really going to do this? We're just going to leave her?
217) 
Glen's right; we've got to help.
218) 
You're right Carley; we need to go back.
219) 
We can look around for a minute.
220) GLENN
[hushed] And if we just HAPPEN to rescue that girl, then good on us.
221) LEE
[hushed] Yes, then good on us.
222) 
Yes; we have to go back.
223) 
Fine, you're right. Let's help.
224) GLENN
[hushed,angry] Fine.
225) GLENN
[hushed, angry] Let's just go.
226) LEE
[Hushed] Yeah, Glenn. I'm sorry, we need to get back now that you're ok.
227) CARLEY
[hushed] It's for the best.
228) CARLEY
[hushed] All right, Lee. We'll follow your lead.
229) GLENN
[hushed] The quieter, the better. When they got the jump on me, they all came out from that forest behind us. We don' t know how many are roaming around in there, looking for something to eat.
230) LEE
[hushed] Yeah we are. Minimal noise. From the looks of it we've got that walker over there, the one by the car, and the one by the stairs.
231) CARLEY
[hushed] If we're going to do this, we're doing it right.
232) GLENN
[hushed] Ok, so she's trapped in that room up there. I say we get up there as quiet as possible, get her out, and then hustle back to my car.
233) CARLEY
[hushed] Plus the two in front of the door.
234) LEE
[talking through a door] If you open up, we can take you somewhere safer. We've got a group in town.
235) GLENN
She's in trouble!
236) LEE
In a minute.
237) MOTEL GIRL
[upset, through door] No no no! Please no.
238) LEE
Hello in there? We're here to help.
240) MOTEL GIRL
[upset, through door] Please, just go away!
241) LEE
[talking through door] Miss! We're coming in!
242) GLENN
You might want to break through that board first.
243) MOTEL GIRL
Stop, just stop. I'm coming out.
244) MOTEL GIRL
It's too late for that.
245) LEE
You're hurt.
246) CARLEY
[terse, under your breath] GLENN.
247) GLENN
What?!
355) GLENN
What?!
373) LEE
{DisgustA}What?
248) MOTEL GIRL
I told you. I said go away, I'm bit. But you wouldn't just leave.
249) MOTEL GIRL
I won't be fine. My boyfriend was bitten. You get sick and you die and you come back and you kill anything you can find.
250) CARLEY
Oh, God.
251) MOTEL GIRL
I...I said stay away.
252) GLENN
We need to get you help.
253) CARLEY
Guys, she's been bitten.
254) GLENN
You have a boyfriend?
255) MOTEL GIRL
I don't want that. It's not Christian. Please, just leave me, please go.
256) LEE
Let's calm down. You could be fine.
257) 
Ok, we'll leave.
258) 
Come with us, we'll get help.
259) 
What if you turn and come after us?
260) 
...
283) MOTEL GIRL
[falling yell/scream]
288) GLENN
[falling yell/scream]
293) GLENN
[puke]
329) LEE
[a "i just got bitten on the neck" scream]
412) LEE
[a "i just got bitten on the neck" scream]
261) LEE
Ok, we'll leave. Just try to take care of yourself, for whatever time you have left.
262) LEE
Come with us and we'll find you some help.
263) LEE
What if you turn and follow us back to our group?
264) MOTEL GIRL
I know! That was why I was locked away. I can't let this happen to me.
265) MOTEL GIR
L You have a gun.
266) MOTEL GIRL
Can I borrow it?
267) CARLEY
[dubious] So?
268) MOTEL GIRL
You have a gun.
269) LEE
Whoa whoa whoa...
270) MOTEL GIRL
Give it to me. I can just, you know, end this and then - then there's no problem.
271) MOTEL GIRL
PLEASE. I don't want to be one of them. They're...they're...satanic.
272) CARLEY
What do you mean "borrow"?
273) 
Give it to her.
277) LEE
Give it to her.
274) 
We can't let you do that.
275) CARLEY
What? You can't be serious.
276) LEE
Do it.
278) GLENN
This is crazy!
279) MOTEL GIRL
Give it to me, PLEASE!
280) MOTEL GIRL
Then do it for me!
281) LEE
We can't let you do that to yourself.
282) CARLEY
We need to get going.
284) CARLEY
Back up!
285) LEE
Miss...
286) MOTEL GIRL
It's just two seconds, just one bullet, and I can be with my family, and it'll all be fine.
287) MOTEL GIRL
PLEASE!
289) CARLEY
Please, step back.
290) LEE
Whoa, take it easy. We just want to help.
291) MOTEL GIRL
You can't.
292) LEE
[running to stop a girl from killing herself] Nonono no, NO!
294) CARLEY
Let's get out of here.
295) GLENN
Get in!
296) GLENN
This thing's temperamental! The starter gets stuck and I need to give it some love. Do you have a hammer or anything like that?
297) CARLEY
Carley looks dumbfounded and gets in the car.
298) CARLEY
What are you doing?!
299) GLENN
Crap! Hold them off!
307) GLENN
Crap! Hold them off!
300) LEE
[mutters, panicked] Man...
306) LEE
[mutters, panicked] Man...
301) GLENN
It works!
304) GLENN
It works!
302) LEE
That's a little love?!
308) LEE
That's a little love?!
303) LEE
Here!
305) LEE
Here!
309) GLENN
Come on, this stupid thing!
310) LEE
There can't be many bullets left...[shooting a gun]
311) GLENN
It's almost fixed!
312) LEE
Come on, Glenn! There's way too many of them!
313) GLENN
AH! It's stuck again!
314) GLENN
GOT IT!
315) LEE
There's a pillow over there.
316) GLENN
That's about as far as I got when it came to supply gathering.
317) LEE
I might have an idea for it.
318) CARLEY
[pickup1] Good luck smothering them to death...
319) LEE
That's not really what I have in mind.
320) CARLEY
[pickup1] But the noise...
321) LEE
Just follow my lead; stay right behind me.
322) LEE
Get out your gun.
323) GLENN
[hushed, over-excited] That was sick!
324) LEE
I'm going to bash this guy's brains in.
409) LEE
I'm going to bash this guy's brains in.
325) GLENN
That might attract some attention.
407) GLENN
That might attract some attention.
326) CARLEY
[pickup1] [dubious] Yeah...
408) CARLEY
[pickup1] [dubious] Yeah...
327) LEE
Screw it, I'm doing this.
410) LEE
Screw it, I'm doing this.
328) GLENN
Lee! Behind you!
411) GLENN
Lee! Behind you!
330) LEE
That's exactly what I was thinking. [with a wink]
331) GLENN
That could scramble a brain pretty good.
332) LEE
Lee now has awl.
333) GLENN
Lee! Get him!
334) GLENN
For sure!
335) LEE
Thanks for having my back.
336) GLENN
Nice!
337) GLENN
Lee! They're closing in!
338) GLENN
Lee! Ah! AHHH!!! AHHHHHHHH!
340) GLENN
...Fuck.
341) GLENN
That was awesome!
342) LEE
Now let's take care of those two so they don't end up getting the jump on us.
343) LEE
This should make short work of the walkers upstairs. Plus it'll come in handy back on the street.
344) GLENN
[under his breath] I hope you're never trapped and need someone's help...
345) 
Let's head back.
346) 
I'm sorry, ok?
347) 
She's probably fine.
352) LEE
She's probably fine.
348) 
Get over it, ok?
358) LEE
Get over it, ok?
349) LEE
Let's just head back.
354) LEE
Let's just head back.
359) LEE
Let's just head back.
350) GLENN
Whatever.
351) LEE
I'm sorry, all right?
353) GLENN
Yeah I'm sure she just strolled out of the room up there, no problem.
356) GLENN
Screw you, man.
357) LEE
I said get over it. You can't help everybody. We've got folks back at the drugstore who need us more than she did.
360) LEE
Two more.
361) GLENN
That should help. [with a wink]
362) GLENN
That could've gone better.
363) LEE
We'll just have to kill him the old fashioned way, I guess.
364) CARLEY
[pickup1] Lee!! NO!!!
365) LEE
Aww SHIT!
366) CARLEY
[pickup1] Hey, look, we don't know what's going on up there. I'm putting out one more vote for going back.
368) LILLY
{body-HoldWrist}{HappyA}Hey, Lee; do you have a second?
369) LILLY
{body-HoldWrist}{HappyA}Hey, Lee; you got a second?
370) LEE
{HappyA}We'll try.
371) GLENN
{NormalB}You guys be safe.
372) GLENN
{NormalA}Yeah, I know you will. But sometimes...{NormalC} you know...
374) GLENN
{ThinkingA}Sometimes it's not always about {FearA}being safe.  {NormalC}Anyways, uh, see ya.
375) GLENN
[Ugh] Let's just do this. Lee?
376) 
We're saving this girl.
377) 
Yeah, let's just go back.
378) CARLEY
[pickup1] Come on, let's go save Glenn's damsel in distress.
379) LEE
I'm just saying.
380) LEE
No, we're saving this girl. Carley, you can go back if you want to.
381) CARLEY
[pickup1] Guilt me, why don't you.
382) LEE
I don't feel good about this, either way. We need to get back to our people.
383) GLENN
I can't...what? Really?... I'm not going.
384) GLENN
Really?!
385) CARLEY
[pickup1] Then we're taking your car. Give Lee the walkie-talkie and you can deal with this on your own.
386) GLENN
But...
387) LEE
I'm sorry, Glenn. Let's go protect the people we know we can.
388) LEE
Let's go back.
389) GLENN
Rad.
390) LEE
We can do something with that car, I bet, if it weren't for that fella lurking near the front.
391) LEE
He's not going anywhere.
392) LEE
Ok, there are two roaming around the RV. We can probably hide over there for a second or two if we time it right.
393) LEE
I'm not sure I can take them both out myself, even if I had a weapon.
394) GLENN
I can watch your back, but it'd be nice if I wasn't empty handed.
395) LEE
This pick is the prime walker killer. I should be able to take those guys out when they come around the corner of the RV.
396) LEE
If we time it right, we should be able to take them both out quietly. Glenn, you just keep the other one back.
397) GLENN
An age old problem.
398) LEE
Well, I've got one pillow and two corpses.
399) GLENN
He keeps going back and forth.
400) LEE
He's just roaming around over there.
401) LEE
We're probably going to have to handle him the old fashioned way.
402) LEE
[observational] Into that ice-pick sized hole.
403) GLENN
Dude, where'd your weapon go?
404) GLENN
It's cool, now we've got THIS.
405) CARLEY
[pickup1] Are you two done?
406) GLENN
Haha, holy shit.
413) CARLEY
[pickup1] Thank effing GOD.
414) LEE
They don't even see us.
415) LEE
They really want to get into that room.
416) GLENN
Now we just have to get it quietly.
417) LEE
I think I found a pretty damn good way to stop these guys quietly.
418) GLENN
Hey man, that drew some attention. Be careful.
419) LEE
Ow!
420) LEE
I'm done trying to punch out windows.
421) LEE
One more of those ought to do it.
422) GLENN
They didn't hear a thing!
423) LEE
Shit. I'll try to not do that again.
424) GLENN
Whoa, dude! That was loud. And those guys heard it.
425) GLENN
LEE! Seriously, man! They're getting wise!
426) GLENN
DUDE! No more noise, man, we're fucked... you gotta...
427) LEE
I don't really know. Do you have any tricks for getting into cars?
428) GLENN
Not without tools or making a bunch of noise. And none with pillows.
429) GLENN
What are you going to do with that?
430) LEE
[hushed] Push on three! One, two...three!
431) LEE
Yeah, until a crowd of them stumbles out of the forest. Let's get the axe and get out of here.
432) GLENN
Look!
433) GLENN
What...what do you think...?
434) LEE
I don't know Glenn, we got to move.
435) USE_CAR_DOOR DIR
(<<author>>Sean Vanaman, Mon Sep 26 19:04:18 2011<<date:1317089058>>) Lee opens the car door quietly and can see inside.
436) LEE
[pickup1] [hushed, sharp] Cover me.
437) LEE
[pickup1][hushed] Probably shouldn't go that way.
438) LEE
[pickup1][hushed] That way's not safe.
439) LEE
[pickup1][hushed] Carley, stay here.
440) LEE
[pickup1][hushed] Glenn, stay here.
441) LEE
[pickup1][hushed] Glenn, let's go. [running to a new station - quick and fast]
