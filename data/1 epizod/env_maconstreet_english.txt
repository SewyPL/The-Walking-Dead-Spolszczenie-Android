1) KENNY
{fearA} Well, this is as far as we're going.
2) LEE
{happyA} Then it's far enough.
3) DUCK
{confusedA} Look!
4) KENNY
{disgustA}{body-standC} Hey there!  {sadB}{body-standB} You friendly? Truck's run out of gas.
5) KENNY
{fearC}{body-standD} FUCK!
6) KATJAA
{fearB}{body-standarmsout} We're TRAPPED!
7) DUCK
{fearB} WAAH!!
8) DUCK
{fearC} AHHH! NO! NO!!!
9) GLENN
{fearC}{body-standA} RUN!!!
10) LEE
[keeping quiet] {disgustB}{body-A} ...Jesus.
11) DOUG
[keeping quiet] {fearA} I think I'm going to be sick.
12) LEE
[keeping quiet] {disgustA} They just...
13) DOUG
[keeping quiet][finishing lee's thought] {fearA} Eat. As far as I can tell, that's all they care about.
14) LEE
[keeping quiet] {sadA} And if one gets you...
15) DOUG
[keeping quiet] {sadB} They eat you, and whatever is left comes back as one of them.
16) LEE
[keeping quiet][in disbelief] {angryA} How the fuck...
17) DOUG
[keeping quiet] {fearA} I think it might be more than a couple days before all this gets sorted out.
18) LEE
[keeping quiet] {thinkingA} Yeah, I think so too. We better keep it down out here.
19) DOUG
{thinkingA}[just hanging out, looking at stuff] Hmm.
20) LEE
[keeping quiet] {normalC}{body-B} The keys to the office might be on that trapped walker over there.
21) DOUG
[keeping quiet] {thinkingA} How can you be sure?
22) LEE
[keeping quiet] {thinkingB} I found this in the office.
23) LEE
[keeping quiet]That boy in the photo worked here. The keys being on him is as good a bet as we can make.
24) DOUG
[keeping quiet]  Yeah, I agree. We just need to {fearA}figure out how to get out there and get them.
25) DOUG
{thinkingA}[just hanging out, looking at stuff] Man�
26) DOUG
{thinkingA}[just hanging out, looking at stuff] Huh.
27) DOUG
{thinkingA}[just hanging out, looking at stuff] Can't believe this is Macon.
28) DOUG
{thinkingA}[just hanging out, looking at stuff] This is crazy.
29) LEE
[keeping quiet] {thinkingA} Any idea where the pharmacy keys might be? [keeping quiet]
555) LEE
[keeping quiet] {thinkingA} Any idea where the pharmacy keys might be? [keeping quiet]
30) DOUG
[keeping quiet] {thinkinga} We searched high and low inside before you guys got here. {fearA}And they weren't on the old couple we took out of the office.
31) DOUG
[keeping quiet] {fearB} Are you ok?
32) LEE
[keeping quiet] {disgustB}I'm fine.
33) 
Any idea where the pharmacy keys might be?
34) LEE
[keeping quiet] {thinkingB} If the keys aren't in the drugstore, think they could be out here?
35) DOUG
[keeping quiet] {fearB} We now live in a world where "getting up and walking away" {fearA}is an actual possibility, so...
36) LEE
[keeping quiet][casual, agreeing] {normalD} Right.
37) LEE
[keeping quiet]The keys might be on that guy over there.
560) 
The keys might be on that guy over there.
38) DOUG
[keeping quiet]{thinkingA}Where?
39) LEE
[keeping quiet][answering] Trapped against the wall over there.
40) DOUG
[keeping quiet]Why do you say that?
41) LEE
[keeping quiet]He, uh... looks like an employee of the drugstore.
43) LEE
[keeping quiet]I've seen him before... he's uh...
44) LEE
[keeping quiet]He's close to the store. Could be him.
45) LEE
[keeping quiet] I don't, I guess.
48) 
I don't, I guess.
46) 
I've seen him before. He's...
47) 
He's close to this store. Could be.
49) 
...
106) LEE
...
107) LEE
[sniff, disregarding the comment, thinking something else to   yourself] {sadC}
112) LEE
[exhales, quietly dealing with the emotion of seeing his brother dead]
116) 
[Remain Silent]
250) 
...
255) LEE
[Breathing heavy, preparing to axe your zombie brother]
256) LEE
[breathing heavy, having just killed his brother]
261) LEE
[panting out of breath after huge zombie fight where you had to hack away at your undead brother]
276) LEE
[scream, getting eaten by zombies]
350) LEE
[axes a zombie in the head, multiple takes]
351) LEE
[axes a zombie in the head, multiple takes]
352) LEE
[axes a zombie in the head, multiple takes]
353) LEE
[axes a zombie in the head, multiple takes]
354) LEE
[axes a zombie in the head, multiple takes]
50) DOUG
[keeping quiet]{fearA}He could be anybody. {thinkingA}We can't just start taking crazy risks.
51) DOUG
[keeping quiet] {thinkingA}We don't know he worked here. That's a big jump to make, considering the risk.
52) DOUG
[keeping quiet] {thinkingA}We can't just assume anything.
573) DOUG
[keeping quiet] {thinkingA}We can't just assume anything.
53) DOUG
{thinkingA}We'd need some proof that he was an employee to make it worth the risk of going out there.
55) DOUG
Sounds good.
170) LEE
Sounds good.
56) LEE
Let's figure out how to search that zombie.
57) 
You ready to do this?
59) LEE
You ready to do this?
58) DOUG
Ready as I'll ever be. Are you good?
60) 
Yes.
61) 
Not yet.
372) 
Not yet.
62) LEE
[keeping quiet] Yeah.
166) DOUG
Yeah.
187) LEE
Yeah.
211) LEE
[agreeing] Yeah.
215) DOUG
[down] Yeah..
63) DOUG
[keeping quiet] {fearA}And the drugstore is safe enough, I think. {thinkingA}Whoever owned it took good care of it. It's well stocked and it locks up well.
64) DOUG
[keeping quiet] Yeah, I think we're good behind this gate.
65) LEE
[keeping quiet] Do you think we're safe here?
72) 
Do you think we're safe here?
66) LEE
[keeping quiet] What's everyone like in there?
73) 
What's everyone like in there?
67) DOUG
[keeping quiet] {fearB}Oh... well, {happyC}Carley is pretty nice, you know.
68) LEE
[keeping quiet] Ha, yeah.
69) DOUG
[keeping quiet] {fearA}Lilly doesn't take any crap. {thinkingA}She's been running the show, keeping people on watch, things like that. And her dad�
70) LEE
[keeping quiet] Yeah, that guy. [THAT guy.]
71) DOUG
[keeping quiet] He's a... well, he's ex-military, I guess. Not the most pleasant.
74) LEE
[keeping quiet] How'd you end up here?
579) 
How'd you end up here?
75) DOUG
[keeping quiet] I moved here to live with my uncle. He does tech stuff and it just made sense.
76) LEE
[keeping quiet] So you're local. You probably knew the owners of this place.
77) DOUG
[keeping quiet]{fearA} No, not really. {normalC}I've only been here a couple months and I spend a lot of time...
78) LEE
[keeping quiet] On the computer.
79) DOUG
[keeping quiet] {Fearb}No. Just, {fearA}doing my own thing.
80) DOUG
[keeping quiet] What about you?
81) LEE
[keeping quiet]  I grew up here. Been trying to get home since the dead came back.
82) LEE
[keeping quiet] I knew some folks here. Seemed like as good a place as any.
83) LEE
[keeping quiet] I just sort of ended up here.
84) LEE
[keeping quiet] What's it matter?
88) 
What's it matter?
85) 
I grew up here.
86) 
I know some folks here.
87) 
I just ended up here.
89) LEE
[keeping quiet] Yeah, I did. Good people.
90) DOUG
[keeping quiet] {fearA}Oh, so {fearB}you probably knew the owners then?
91) LEE
[keeping quiet] Family, but it doesn't seem like it. [that they are alive]
92) DOUG
[keeping quiet] {fearB}Oh, {FearA}friends, family? They around?
93) LEE
[keeping quiet] Yeah.  I'm just taking care of her.
94) DOUG
[keeping quiet] {thinkingA}Oh, cool. You've got that little girl with you.
95) DOUG
[keeping quiet] {happya}I guess it doesn't. {thinkingA}When something like this happens, I suppose all that matters is where you are, not how you got there.
96) 
Exit
97) LEE
[keeping quiet] Let's head back inside.
98) DOUG
[keeping quiet] {thinkingA}OK.
99) 
Go back inside
100) DOUG
{fearB}What? Do you know that guy?
101) LEE
[heart wrenched] {fearB} Oh shit...
102) DOUG
{confusedA} Look at that poor bastard trapped on the other side of the street.
103) LEE
{sadB}{body-B} Yeah. He's my brother.
104) LEE
{normalD}{body-B} Kind of. He...has a familiar face.
105) LEE
{sadA}{body-B} No, it's just sad. Fucked up.
108) DOUG
{sadB}{body-standB} Nevermind, it's not my business. I'm Sorry though.
109) DOUG
{confusedA}{body-standB} Oh�l-like...brother? Or like brother?
110) DOUG
{normalC}{body-standB} Ah. You're from around here, huh?
111) DOUG
{sadA} Yeah, it is. [it's sad, the zombies]
113) 
He could be a drugstore employee.
454) LEE
[pickup1] He could be a drugstore employee.
114) 
Kind of. He has a familiar face.
115) 
No, it's just sad.
118) DOUG
[keeping quiet] {fearA}Nope. I hope he ended up that way and{sadA} wasn't a living guy who got... trapped and THEN bitten...
119) LEE
[keeping quiet] It doesn't seem like that trapped guy is going anywhere anytime soon.
120) LEE
[keeping quiet] [utterly horrified but trying to contain it] Jesus. No kidding.
121) LEE
[keeping quiet] He's still trapped.
123) DOUG
{thinkinga}[keeping quiet]All we need is a way for one of us to spend some time with that guy over there without getting snuck up on.
124) LEE
[keeping quiet]Let's have another look around, there's got to be a safe way to get out there.
125) DOUG
{fearB}Safe'ish.
126) LEE
All right, so that's our guy over there.
127) LEE
We need to keep the rest of the walkers away while I search for them.
128) DOUG
Presumably; he's the one with the keys.
129) LEE
Yeah, I got it.
130) DOUG
You're gonna do it?
131) DOUG
Well, how are we going to keep them away from you?
132) DOUG
[keeping quiet] How are we going to keep those things off your back while you search that one for the keys?
133) DOUG
That's a lot. Don't, you know, touch it. That is, of course, IF you can knock it down.
134) LEE
We get that thing down on the ground and we'd have ourselves a barrier, don't you think?
135) DOUG
It's still carrying a charge
136) LEE
Look at that sagging power line.
137) DOUG
Those distribution lines carry about 33 thousand volts.
138) LEE
And?
139) DOUG
We just have to find a way to get those power lines down on the ground.
140) DOUG
I'll try to give you fair warning.
141) LEE
Do better than try, all right?
142) LEE
I'll need to watch my back.
143) DOUG
We're going to need them on the other side of the street before that thing comes down, though.
144) LEE
That wooden pole is already damaged thanks to that wreck.
174) LEE
That wooden pole is already damaged thanks to that wreck.
145) DOUG
You're right; it shouldn't take more than a few good swings with that fire axe to finish the job.
146) DOUG
We need a way to get all the zombies on the far side of the street.
147) LEE
You want to go for the keys?
148) DOUG
No.
149) DOUG
But if you're still out and visible, there's no guarantee they'll leave you alone to come after me. What are we going to do about that?
150) LEE
This is what we do: when that pole is about to fall, I'll yell for you to run out to that car over there. Hop in and start honking the horn to attract them to the other side of the street.
151) DOUG
I'm going to be honest. I'm not psyched to play the role of bait.
152) DOUG
You need a place to hide while I attract the walkers to the other side of the street.
153) LEE
I'll hop in the trunk of that wrecked car.
154) DOUG
[thinking] Yeah, that'll work.
194) DOUG
[thinking] Yeah, that'll work.
155) LEE
They won't be able to get to me and I'll jump out and finish off the pole when they're over there. Sound good?
195) LEE
They won't be able to get to me and I'll jump out and finish off the pole when they're over there. Sound good?
156) DOUG
Well, insanely dangerous, but good.
197) DOUG
Well, insanely dangerous, but good.
157) LEE
I think it's our best shot. Then I'll take care of...the boy and see about the keys.
196) LEE
I think it's our best shot. Then I'll take care of...the boy and see about the keys.
158) DOUG
Righto.
193) DOUG
Righto.
159) LEE
Let's recap.
160) DOUG
We think that dead gentleman over there has the keys, but we need to figure out how to keep the rest of the walkers at bay while you search him.
161) DOUG
If we can down that power-line in the middle of the street, you'd have a decent barrier between you and the rest of the walkers, but we need a way to knock it down.
162) DOUG
You're going to chop down that power pole, creating a make-shift electric fence between you and the rest of the walkers. But we need a way to herd them to one side of the street before you do.
163) DOUG
I'm going to lure the walkers to the other side of the street with a car horn, but you need a place to get out of sight so they'll lose interest.
164) LEE
That sounds like a plan.
165) DOUG
I think we're set. You run out there and start chopping down that pole, making sure to watch your back. When it's about to fall, you give me the signal and I'll run out to the car and lure them over while you hide in the trunk. Then, when the coast is clear, you hop out, finish off the pole, and then get the keys.
167) LEE
[casual] There's a car wrecked over there.
168) DOUG
Yeah... maybe there's something to that.
169) LEE
[hatching a plan] There's a car crashed into that power-pole.
171) LEE
I wish. We'd need to chop it down or saw it or something.
172) DOUG
I like it. I think it's worth poking around inside and anywhere else you can for an axe or a saw, at least for a little while.
173) DOUG
You think you can knock it over?
175) DOUG
That won't help.
322) LEE
That won't help.
338) LEE
That won't help.
176) DOUG
We've already got that figured.
177) LEE
I need to chop that thing down.
178) LEE
One good push ought to do it.
179) LEE
[doesn't understand stupid reference] What are you talking about?
180) DOUG
Ah, nothing.
181) LEE
[casual] The power-line spans the width of the street.
182) DOUG
Looks in need of a little maintenance. A "power-up," perhaps?
183) LEE
I better stay away from that.
184) LEE
[casual] Kenny's car is over there. It should be unlocked.
185) DOUG
I don't know, there's no gas left and I think they'll get to us eventually.
186) LEE
Maybe we can use Kenny's car?
188) LEE
Well, I guess we either die in a gas fire or those things pluck us out like sardines from a can. So maybe not.
189) DOUG
And if it doesn't work?
190) LEE
[hatching a plan] Maybe we drive another car into it?
191) LEE
Kenny's car is on the other side of the street.
192) LEE
I'm not getting in there.
198) LEE
I'll hop in the trunk.
199) LEE
[casual] There are abandoned vehicles all over the place.
200) LEE
I don't think there's anything we can do with those wrecked cars.
201) DOUG
Me neither.
202) LEE
[hatching a plan] Think there's anything in those wrecked cars that could help?
203) DOUG
I don't think so. And if there was, I'm not sure it'd be worth the risk.
204) LEE
OK, ok, that's out.
205) LEE
[hatching a plan] Maybe you could climb on top of those wrecked cars and start waving your arms?
206) DOUG
Making a list of ways I could die doing that.
207) LEE
What are you doing?
208) DOUG
[making a list in his head] 1...2...3...4...
209) DOUG
It's hard to say, but there's something to that, maybe. You'd be in a lot of danger going that far.
210) LEE
Maybe I could hide amongst those cars?
212) LEE
Were.
213) LEE
They're hard to look at.
214) DOUG
You can still see who they are.
216) LEE
[ looking at a zombie] [Sigh] Man.
217) DOUG
You'd get swarmed.
218) LEE
Maybe we could just kill them all.
219) LEE
I said "we."
220) DOUG
You could take them one at a time, but you need a wall or something to protect you while you search the trapped one.
221) DOUG
Ha, um, right. I don't think so.
222) DOUG
Nope. Especially when we don't know how many are out there.
223) LEE
We can't take them all out.
224) DOUG
If it doesn't, we have bigger problems.
225) LEE
That power-line ought to stop them, don't you think?
226) DOUG
Meat, apparently. Or a noise, maybe.
227) LEE
What do you think could get them on the other side of the street?
228) LEE
If I were to hide from the walkers, you think you can distract them?
229) DOUG
Yeah, but where are you gonna hide?
230) LEE
[sigh] God. Poor kid. [holding back his emotions, talking about seeing his zombie brother]
231) DOUG
Yeah. You'll be pretty well exposed while you search him.
232) LEE
He's kind of out in the open over there, isn't he?
233) LEE
I don't think he has anything on him that will help us down that power line.
234) DOUG
[agreeing] Nope.
308) DOUG
[agreeing] Nope.
235) LEE
He won't help us get the zombies on the other side of the street.
236) LEE
Maybe I can pretend to be a zombie like him.
237) DOUG
That could quickly turn into you not pretending. Not a good idea.
238) LEE
{thinkingA}{body-B} I need to knock this wire down before I start rummaging around on him.
239) LEE
{sadA}{body-C} All right, time to see if he has the keys.
240) LEE
{disgustB}{body-F} Hey, bud.
241) LEE
{thinkingB} I don't know what happened to mom and dad. But I know...if you were there, you would've died for them, so...uh...  {sadB} Yeah. I'm going to assume that's what happened.
242) LEE
[yelling back to Doug] {angryB} Give me a second.
243) DOUG
{surprisedA}{body-standC} Did you find them yet?!
244) LEE
I'm sorry I wasn't here.
247) 
I'm sorry I wasn't here.
245) LEE
I shouldn't have left.
248) 
I shouldn't have left.
246) LEE
I have to finish you off, now.
249) 
I have to finish you off, now.
251) LEE
[quiet, talking to his dead brother]  {thinkingB}{body-F} But knowing you were... to take care of them, through all of it. That helped.
252) LEE
[quiet, talking to his dead brother] {sadB}{body-F} I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry I wasn't here.
253) LEE
[quiet, talking to his dead brother] {sadB}{body-F} I shouldn't have left the family. {disgustB} Fuck, I mean, you know what I mean.
254) LEE
[about to have to kill his zombie brother] {sadC}{body-F} I got to do this now, man. {angryA} I got to do this.
257) LEE
{fearB}{body-C} FUCK!
258) LEE
[pickup3]	[having to hack away at your brother who is a zombie who won't die] {angryD}{body-C} RWAHHH!
259) LEE
[pickup3][having to hack away at your brother who is a zombie who won't die] RWAHHH!
260) LEE
[pickup3][having to hack away at your brother who is a zombie who won't die] RWAHHH!
262) LEE
[Lee bends down and searches the zombies pockets for the keys, finding them pretty quickly. It's uncomfortable though. He's close to his mangled brother's body and he's holding back equal amounts of vomit and tears.] {disgustB}{body-F} Ugh...[gulp]...God...[sniff]...[improvise]
263) DOUG
{fearC} RUN!
264) DOUG
{surprisedA}HOLY CRAP!
265) LEE
[UTTERLY RELIEVED] {thinkingA} There we go.
266) LEE
There's a pretty gnarly car-wreck over there.
267) DOUG
[agreeing] Probably not.
268) LEE
Think there's anything in that car to keep them back?
269) DOUG
The wreck did damage to that power pole...
270) LEE
Maybe that car can help.
271) DOUG
[agreeing] No, probably not.
346) DOUG
No, probably not.
272) LEE
The wreck probably won't help.
273) LEE
I'll get in that trunk when I have to.
274) LEE
[to himself] Shit, come on Doug.
275) LEE
[to himself] Is this guy trying to kill me? Come the fuck on...
277) LEE
[quiet, whisper, to himself] Still there...
278) LEE
[quiet, whisper, to himself] I better close this thing...
279) LEE
Just some dumpsters.
291) LEE
Just some dumpsters.
280) DOUG
Nah.
284) DOUG
Nah.
292) DOUG
Nah.
297) DOUG
Nah.
281) LEE
[hatching a plan] Think the dumpsters could be of any help?
285) LEE
[hatching a plan] Think the dumpsters could be of any help?
293) LEE
[hatching a plan] Think the dumpsters could be of any help?
296) LEE
[hatching a plan] Think the dumpsters could be of any help?
282) DOUG
Yeah, I don't think so.
294) DOUG
Yeah, I don't think so.
283) LEE
[hatching a plan] Dumpsters probably won't do any good.
295) LEE
[hatching a plan] Dumpsters probably won't do any good.
286) LEE
[hatching a plan] Maybe I hide in trash.
299) LEE
[hatching a plan] Maybe I hide in trash.
287) DOUG
You really want to do that?
301) DOUG
You really want to do that?
288) LEE
Not particularly.
302) LEE
Not particularly.
289) DOUG
Plus you might get stuck. There's somewhere better.
300) DOUG
Plus you might get stuck. There's somewhere better.
290) LEE
[hatching a plan] Dumpsters are out.
298) LEE
[hatching a plan] Dumpsters are out.
303) LEE
People tried to board up downtown, huh?
304) DOUG
Yeah, you know. They did their best.
305) LEE
Lure them inside somewhere, maybe?
306) DOUG
Dangerous, I don't think so.
307) LEE
[hatching a plan] Nothing in there...
309) LEE
[hatching a plan] Boarded up windows won't help.
310) DOUG
There's got to be somewhere better.
311) LEE
[hatching a plan] I could hide in there, maybe?
312) LEE
I don't know.

{fearA}[pickup1] I don't know...

How would you get in?

That's what they do.

That's what they do.

They tore him..or her...or it... apart.

I don't think that'll work. Not when they can get fresh meat.

I don't think that'll work. Not when they can get fresh meat.
321) LEE
Yeah, got it.
336) LEE
Yeah, got it.
323) LEE
All right, let's figure this out.
324) DOUG
We can't just go out there without a plan. That's suicide.

Whoa, Lee! Don't go out there.

You ready?

Let's do this.

All right, I'm right behind you.

Fair enough. I'm ready when you are.

There's junk all over the place out there.
340) DOUG
Yeah, it doesn't look like America, does it?
341) LEE
Well, some parts. Just not downtown Macon.

Can't do anything with that debris, I don't think.

Can't do anything with that debris, I don't think.

If I keep at it, I'll be able to knock that thing down.

376) LEE
[pickup1] [keeping quiet] The streets are too full of those things to get out there and search for those keys safely.
