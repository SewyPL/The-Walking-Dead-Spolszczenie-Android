624) KENNY
{angryA}Well, Clementine isn't with them, so fuck 'em.
625) LEE
[with growing frustration] {thinkingB}Couldn't they have left ANYTHING useful?!
626) LEE
[slightly frustrated, mild projection]{thinkingB}This led to the stairs...[Although the exit is welded shut, It's actually a good thing]{fearA} Looks like it's flooded with walkers up there.
627) CHRISTA
[commenting on the stairwell entrance being welded shut][slight Projection]{angryA}Guess it's a good thing they're sealed up then.
628) KENNY
[commenting on the stairwell entrance being welded shut][Slight Projection]{FearA}Vernon's group's got the place sealed up pretty tight.
629) LEE
[looking at a door thats been welded shut]{thinkingB}Not gettin' out that way.
630) LEE
[looking at the door to the sewers, zombies are behind it]{angryA}Can't those things let up for a fucking minute?!
631) BEN
{thinkingA}That door should hold 'em back for a while, {fearA}but we've gotta get out of here soon.

{thinkingA}Yeah, we just have to get the hell out of here.
683) CHRISTA

684) LEE
{thinkingB}I think we can get out through the elevator shaft, {fearA}but the doors are stuck shut!
685) KENNY
{thinkingA}Well, there's gotta be SOMETHING around here you can pry 'em open with!  {angryA}Look around!
686) CHRISTA
{angryA}Well, do it then.  This door won't hold forever.
687) LEE
