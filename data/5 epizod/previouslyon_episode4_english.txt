1) LEE
Previously on The Walking Dead...
2) CLEMENTINE
What if my parents come home and I'm not there?
3) CLEMENTINE
I've got my walkie-talkie in case they try that way.
4) CARLEY
Hey. There were some batteries in one of those boxes.
5) DOUG
Here, Clem.  Want some... uhh... batteries?
6) KENNY
Baby, you've gotta see this!
7) CARLEY
[sweetly, giving batteries to Clem]Here, you can have some too...
8) VERNON
You didn't come into town from the railroad did you?
9) BEN
WE GOTTA GO!
10) KENNY
Yeah, why?
11) LEE
Clementine? [louder, desperate]  Clementine!!!
12) LEE
No.  No!
13) LEE
Clementine's gone. Wherever she is, I have to find her.
14) OMID
You're not thinking of going after her alone, are you?
15) LEE
This is something I have to do alone.
16) LEE
We have a better chance of finding her if we all go together. Who's with me?
17) KENNY
Sorry partner, no dice. No way I'm letting you do this alone.
18) KENNY
What kind of friend would I be if I wasn't there for you now??
19) KENNY
I don't know why you're looking over here, Lee.
20) KENNY
If this was me asking you for help, would you be there for me?
21) LEE
You know what, Kenny? Go fuck yourself.
22) LEE
I need your help. Please.
23) LEE
She's my family now. She's all I've got.
24) KENNY
Hell... in the end, family's all that matters.
25) KENNY
{SadA}[sighs]
26) KENNY
I'm sorry, but you're on your own on this one.
27) KENNY
I'm sorry, but you're on your own on this one.
28) LEE
Maybe you should stay with the boat.
29) BEN
Okay. Sure.
30) BEN
I don't want to cause any trouble. If Kenny doesn't want me to go, I'll stay here.
31) LEE
[to ben]You know I think it'd be best if you stayed behind with the boat...
32) BEN
Uh... maybe it's best that I stayed here. I don't want to go where I'm not wanted.
33) BEN
Whatever I can do to help, you can count on me.
34) BEN
I think maybe it's best I stayed behind.
35) BEN
You're right. I owe her.
36) BEN
I swear, before this is all over, I'm gonna show you I can do something right.
37) BEN
Somehow, I gotta make it right.
38) CLEMENTINE
[radio] Lee?
39) LEE
Clementine!
40) CAMPMAN
Hello, Lee...
41) LEE
I don't know how much time I've got. I'm gonna need your help to find her.
42) LEE
I don't know if I can even ask for your help....
43) LEE
I think we should look for your parents.
44) CLEMENTINE
We'll be IN Savannah and my parents were in Savannah.
45) CLEMENTINE
Can we at least LOOK for my parents when we get there?
46) CLEMENTINE
Well, uhh... I want to find my parents.
47) LEE
Is this it? The Marsh House?
48) CLEMENTINE
Yes, that's it.
49) CLEMENTINE
They always stay in the same place when they go there.
50) CHRISTA
Good luck, Lee. I mean that.
51) CHRISTA
We'll look for Clementine together.
52) OMID
Hell yeah.
53) CHRISTA
I hope you find her. {WorriedA}But you're going to have to do it without us.
54) KENNY
You'd rather trust Clementine's life with this incompetent fuck than with me?
55) KENNY
I'll stay behind and work on the boat.
