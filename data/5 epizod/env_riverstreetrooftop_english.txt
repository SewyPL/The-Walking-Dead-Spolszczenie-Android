1) CHRISTA
Do you want to talk?
2) 
Let's stay focused.
3) 
Kenny was my friend.
4) 
I blame the fucker who took Clem.
5) CHRISTA
{Body-A}{AngryA}I guess that's a no, then.
6) OMID
He just lost two friends; it's pretty understandable, right?
7) LEE
{Body-B}{SadA}Nothing to say; {AngryA}we need to stay focused on what we're doing.
8) CHRISTA
{Body-A}{NormalB}I know we can't just take a minute, {WorriedA}but... {SadA}you're not a machine.
9) LEE
{Body-B}{SadA}Kenny was my friend.
10) CHRISTA
{Body-A}{ThinkingA}Soon as someone dies, they {WorriedA}don't immediately have to have their sins forgiven.
11) LEE
He was what passes for a friend now.
12) CHRISTA
{NormalB}I understand.
13) LEE
{Body-B}{SadA}He could be tough to like, {NormalC}but I agreed with him most the time; {HappyA}so we were assholes together, {NormalD}I guess.
14) LEE
That's two on him, now. The motherfucker who's got Clementine has Ben and Kenny to answer for.
15) CHRISTA
{Body-A}{WorriedA}Keep a clear head, Lee.
16) LEE
We wouldn't be out here. {AngryB}We'd all been together to defend against Vernon {AngryC}and we'd be out on the water. {SadB}Everyone would be alive.
17) CHRISTA
Look, Lee, this is a shitty time, but I want to clear something up.
18) LEE
What is it? [determined, distracted]
19) CHRISTA
{Body-A}{ThinkingA}Clementine. {SadA}I know Kenny was your guy.
20) LEE
{Body-B}{NormalB}Yeah. [what of it]
21) CHRISTA
{AngryA}Well?
123) CHRISTA
[sigh] Well.
22) 
Ain't much choice, now.
23) 
Find her a family that's...capable.
60) 
Find her a family that's capable.
24) 
You guys would be great for her.
61) 
You guys would be great for her.
25) LEE
{Body-B}{NormalC}Ain't much choice now.
26) CHRISTA
{Body-A}{AngryB}No, there isn't.
27) OMID
{Body-A}{SickA}Easy, Christa.
28) CHRISTA
{AngryA}I don't care that he's who you wanted, {ThinkingA}but I want you to know that {WorriedA}you don't need to worry.
29) LEE
{NormalD}Okay.
30) LEE
{Body-B}{DisgustA}Just take care of her as long as you can, {AngryA}then find her a family that's capable.
247) LEE
{Body-B}{DisgustA}Just take care of her as long as you can, {AngryA}then find her a family that's capable.
31) OMID
{Body-A}{AngryA}We're capable.
250) OMID
{Body-A}{AngryA}We're capable.
32) LEE
{ThinkingA}You and your girlfriend might want different things.
249) LEE
{ThinkingA}You and your girlfriend might want different things.
33) CHRISTA
{Body-A}{AngryA}That's enough.
251) CHRISTA
{Body-A}{AngryA}That's enough.
34) LEE
{AngryA}Fine. {NormalC}But you heard me.
248) LEE
{AngryA}Fine. {NormalC}But you heard me.
35) CHRISTA
She'll be fine, Lee.
246) CHRISTA
She'll be fine, Lee.
36) LEE
{Body-B}{HappyA}You guys would be great for her. {ThinkingA}Keep her safe.
37) CHRISTA
{Body-A}{HappyA}We'd do our best, {ThinkingA}you know that.
38) 
Are you... okay?
39) 
What's going on with you?
40) 
Good. Thanks.
41) LEE
{Body-B}{NormalD}Are you... {SadA}okay?
42) CHRISTA
{Body-A}{SadA}I should be asking you that.
43) LEE
Before, in the attic.
44) CHRISTA
{ThinkingA}It's nothing.
50) CHRISTA
{ThinkingA}It's nothing.
45) OMID
What's nothing?
51) OMID
What's nothing?
46) CHRISTA
{DisgustA}Let's just keep moving.
52) CHRISTA
{DisgustA}Let's just keep moving.
47) LEE
{Body-B}{ThinkingA}What's going on with you?
48) CHRISTA
I just saw your friends get killed.
49) LEE
I mean before, back at the attic.
53) LEE
{Body-B}{NormalB}Good. {HappyA}Thanks. Whatever your best is, {ThinkingA}I'll trust it.
54) CHRISTA
{Body-A}{HappyA}That's all you can do.
55) CHRISTA
{Body-A}{ThinkingA}Omid and I have to stay safe. For her.
56) 
Yeah, you do.
57) LEE
{Body-B}{ThinkingA}Yeah, you do. {NormalC}Let me take all the risks.
58) CHRISTA
{Body-A}{WorriedA}That's not what I mean, {ThinkingA}necessarily.
59) LEE
{AngryA}It's what I mean. {ThinkingA}It's what we gotta do.
62) CHRISTA
[frustrated] {Body-A}{AngryA}Just... {AngryB}fuck. You don't have to worry about anything, {AngryA}okay? {ThinkingA}Not that it seems like you are.
63) CHRISTA
{Body-A}{AngryA}That's that, then.
64) OMID
{Body-A}{ThinkingA}Yeah, that's that, hon.
65) CHRISTA
Fuck, be careful across here.
66) OMID
River Street's just up ahead.
67) OMID
[hushed] Whoa, careful.
68) CHRISTA
[hushed] Even the buildings are full....
69) OMID
[hushed] They never know where their next meal is.
70) 
No. They don't.
73) LEE
[hushed] No. They don't.
71) 
That's a thing to say.
76) LEE
[hushed]That's a thing to say.
72) 
Be careful through here.
79) LEE
Be careful through here.
74) OMID
