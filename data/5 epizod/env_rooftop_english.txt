554) KENNY
{fearA} You can make it! It ain't that far!
555) CHRISTA
{fearB} Fuck, be careful!
556) BEN
{fearC} WHAT?!
557) LEE
{fearA} It's the only way!
558) KENNY
[yelling across the gap] Just one big leap!
559) KENNY
[yelling across the gap] You got it, Lee!
560) KENNY
[yelling across the gap] JUMP!
561) KENNY
[yelling across the gap] What are you waiting for?!
562) KENNY
[yelling across the gap] You gotta do this, pal!
563) OMID
[yelling across a gap] You can do it!
569) BEN
[yelling across a gap] You can do it!
564) OMID
[yelling across a gap] Don't look down!
565) OMID
[yelling across a gap] Just jump!
566) OMID
[yelling across a gap] You're psyching yourself out!
567) OMID
[yelling across a gap]  We gotta go! Jump!
568) BEN
[yelling across a gap] It's, uh, not that far!
570) BEN
[yelling across a gap] I believe in you!
572) BEN
[yelling across a gap] One, two, THREE!
573) LEE
{normalb}See anything?
658) LEE
{normalb}See anything?
574) BEN
{thinkinga}There's a fire escape here; {sada}that's about it.
575) LEE
{normalc}Hey, Ben.
576) 
You came with me.
596) LEE
{thinkinga}You came with me.
577) 
You still want to die?
579) LEE
{angrya}You still want to die?
578) BEN
{sada}I'm more {sadb}afraid of getting someone else killed.
580) BEN
{feara}I'm still afraid of getting eaten; more than ever.
581) LEE
{sada}Well, you're here. {angrya}Don't get ME killed.
582) 
You're here. Don't get me killed.
583) LEE
{normalb}Are you afraid?
585) 
If it ends up being you and Clem...
586) BEN
{angrya}Don't talk like that.
587) LEE
{sadb}The way things have been going, {angrya}I don't have any choice, Ben.
588) LEE
{angrya}When it all comes down to it, if it's just you and Clementine for some reason, {sada}I think you'll have plenty of reason to want to live.
589) 
I'll make sure that doesn't happen.
590) BEN
{fearb}Really...?
644) OMID
{happyb}Really?
591) LEE
{happya}Getting bitten's not that bad.
592) LEE
{normalc}I'll make sure that doesn't happen, as well as I can.
593) BEN
{sada}Thanks... {sadb}including me?
594) LEE
{angrya}No. It's a death sentence. {sadb}It's horrible. {angrya}But try not to worry about it.
595) BEN
{sada}...I don't think anything could change that.
597) BEN
{sada}You didn't think I would?
598) BEN
{normala}It's like you said, {happya}Clementine has been my biggest... {sadb}well... only real fan. {angrya}I'd be a big piece of crap if I didn't.
599) BEN
{sada}Just, with {thinkinga}all we've been through, {sadb}it seemed like the only reasonable thing to do.
600) LEE
{thinkinga}If we get over to that bell tower {happya}we might have some impact on all those walkers out there.
601) BEN
{fearb}But then we just run through the streets? {sada}I dunno...
602) LEE
{angrya}If we use that bell tower to lure all the walkers towards that side of the hospital, {happya}the road to the mansion and River Street shouldn't be too bad.
603) BEN
{sada}Yeah, okay... {angrya}but you still have to get over there.
604) BEN
{fearb}I think I'm staring down at my worst nightmare. {disgusta}Just a dusty haze of death.
605) LEE
{thinkinga}What do you think?
754) 
What do you think?
606) LEE
{angrya}Try to keep your shit together. We need to get off of this roof.
607) LEE
Anything over here?
608) CHRISTA
{sada}Honestly, my vision isn't great. {angrya}I think it's allergies or all that {disgusta}shit those walkers are kicking up.
609) LEE
{sada}Hey.
635) LEE
{sada}Hey.
610) 
Allergies. That's funny.
611) LEE
{normalb}There's a bell tower over there.
751) 
There's a bell tower over there.
612) CHRISTA
{feara}You think you could pull all those bastards this way?
613) LEE
{angrya}Hopefully, yeah. {thinkinga}Maybe clear out the other way.
614) LEE
{normalb}The mansion's that way.
615) LEE
{angrya}If we can use that bell tower to bring them to that side of the hospital, {sada}it won't be an easy trip back towards River Street, {happya}but it wouldn't be impossible.
616) CHRISTA
{happya}I'm with you. {worrieda}Just have to get over there.
618) LEE
{sada}I know. It's this deal with Clem... it's everything; {angrya}it's put this rage inside me {angryb}like I can't even say.
619) LEE
{surpriseb}I used to get allergies too. {normalb}And just... {thinkinga}fuck. Who was that guy?
620) CHRISTA
{worrieda}Someone with priorities?
621) LEE
{sada}Allergies... shit. People used to get those.
622) CHRISTA
{happya}I know, right. {worrieda}You never see anybody in an end of the world story with hayfever.
623) CHRISTA
{happya}It's not the time to get wistful. [she doesn't meant it]
624) 
I was worried you wouldn't come with me.
625) LEE
{thinkinga}I was thinking you and Omid wouldn't come with me.
626) LEE
{happya}Well, I appreciate it.
724) LEE
{happya}Well, I appreciate it.
627) LEE
{happyb}You two have been solid since day one.
722) LEE
{happyb}You two have been solid since day one.
628) CHRISTA
{sada}We look out for each other, {angrya}but we sure as hell weren't gonna let you go alone, {worrieda}not with that time bomb chewed into your wrist.
629) CHRISTA
{happya}What is this, day three? Four?
723) CHRISTA
{happya}What is this, day three? Four?
630) CHRISTA
{worrieda}You guys have taken care of us; we take care of you.
631) LEE
{happya}I appreciate it.
632) LEE
{normalb}What's up over here?
633) OMID
{happya}Bell tower. That's what's up.
634) LEE
{surpriseb}Huh. {happya}Yeah. That could help.
636) 
I think you're Clem's favorite.
637) OMID
{angryb}When we get this fucker, we'll get out of sight and leave you with him.
638) OMID
You get me?
639) LEE
{happya}Yeah, she's a big fan. {thinkinga}You get away with shit I never would.
640) LEE
{happya}I get you.
641) OMID
{angrya}We're getting her back, Lee. You know that, right?
642) LEE
{happyb}I think you're Clem's favorite, you know that?
645) 
I'll see if we can make it to that bell tower.
646) 
How's the leg?
650) LEE
{sada}How's the leg?
647) LEE
{happya}Thanks.
648) LEE
{angrya}I'll see if we can make it out to that bell tower.
649) OMID
{sada}Okay, be careful though; I don't want you going any sooner than you have to.
652) LEE
{happya}She's something, right?
653) OMID
{happya}It's good. {angrya}Wouldn't mean shit if you hadn't left Clementine with me when you went in to Crawford. {sadb}That little girl saved my life.
654) OMID
{happya}Yeah. {sada}Don't worry more than you should about her, okay?
655) OMID
{happya}It's doing a lot better. Thanks for going into Crawford for me, {sada}even if it wasn't entirely FOR me. {happyb}Clementine too. {angrya}She's tough as hell.
656) LEE
{sada}Isn't she?
657) KENNY
{sada}Nah. {angrya}I'm just, uh, {sada}taking a minute, actually. {sadb}I'm sorry; I know I shouldn't.
659) LEE
{happya}Hey, Ken.
660) 
What's going on?
662) LEE
{thinkinga}What's going on?
661) KENNY
{sada}Just... everything. {angryb}Ah, fuck man. {sadc}You know.
664) KENNY
{sada}I can't thank you enough for what you did for Duck. {sadb}I don't know how I'd be if you hadn't--
665) LEE
{sada}Don't dwell on it.
666) LEE
{sadb}Ken--
667) KENNY
[pulls out of it]{angrya} No. I'm sorry. We're in a fucking hurry to get off this roof; it's not the time. {sada}I'm sorry. {angrya}I'm okay.
668) KENNY
{feara}I look at where we are, right now, {angryb}and I can't imagine {sadb}Kat and Duck in all this mess.
669) KENNY
{sada}I'm... glad I was on the one who did it. I can tell myself, forever, that I saved him from the worst of it.
670) LEE
{normalb}Yeah, could be part of how we get through the streets.
671) LEE
{thinkinga}There's bell tower over there.
672) KENNY
{normalb}We know what those do.
674) KENNY
{happya}I can do that, yeah.
675) LEE
{normalb}The mansion's that way; {normalc}the bell tower's over there; if we go down the opposite side of the roof, {happya}we might be able to make it without too much trouble.
676) LEE
{sada}Any thoughts about... anything else?
677) KENNY
{sada}Nah, I'm all right. Just needed to take a second. {angrya}I'll keep an eye out over here. {happya}Sorry.
678) 
How many you think are below us?
679) LEE
{sada}Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
680) LEE
{feara}How many you think are wandering around underneath us right now?
681) KENNY
{feara}And out there? {sada}Look at that dust. {angrya}Fuck, man, who knows?
682) KENNY
{surpriseda}In the hospital? Thousands. {thinkinga}Who knows? It was full of dead before, right?
