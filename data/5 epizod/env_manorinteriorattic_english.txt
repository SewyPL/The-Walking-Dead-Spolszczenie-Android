1) KENNY
[gathering himself]{FearA} That could've gone better.
2) CHRISTA
{FearA} Everyone okay?
3) KENNY
{ThinkingA} Lee's still bitten.
4) CHRISTA
{AngryA} Shut up.
5) OMID
{NormalA} Okay, let's get out of here and keep movin'.
6) KENNY
{ThinkingA} Kid's right; we gotta keep moving. {FearA} Think there's any chance we get Clem {AngryA} and catch up to those goddamn thieves?
7) LEE
[pickup1] [re-record so lee doesn't sound too healthy]{NormalD} I don't know. {NormalC} Maybe.
8) OMID
{ThinkingA} Well, we're not going out through this window. {NormalB} No latches, no roof access and thirty feet straight down.
9) 
We shouldn't have come up here.
10) 
There's gotta be another way.
11) 
We fight our way through the house.
12) LEE
[pickup1] [re-record so lee doesn't sound too healthy]{NormalD} We shouldn't have come up here.
13) KENNY
{ThinkingA} Where else would we have gone? {FearA} The streets are a river of walkers and they were comin' in from all sides.
14) CHRISTA
{FearA} We're no good to Clementine dead.
22) CHRISTA
{FearA} We're no good to Clementine dead.
15) LEE
[pickup1] [re-record so lee doesn't sound too healthy]{NormalD} There's gotta be another way.
16) CHRISTA
{NormalA} Check the floor for any other access, {FearA} a vent, anything.
24) CHRISTA
{NormalA} Check the floor for any other access, {FearA} a vent, anything.
17) KENNY
{NormalB} Or we wait for the house to clear out and stick to the high ground.
18) LEE
[pickup1] [re-record so lee doesn't sound too healthy] Can't we fight our way back through the house? I've got a weapon, {NormalD} what else do we have?
19) CHRISTA
{FearA} Not much.
20) KENNY
{ThinkingA} It'd be a goddamn mess going back down there.
21) BEN
{FearA} I'll go.
23) KENNY
{NormalB} Well, we've gotta do something. We're alive, but {ThinkingA} we'll go fucking crazy up here.
25) KENNY
{FearA} Whoa, Lee, you okay?
26) LEE
{NormalD} Yeah, yeah, I'm --
27) LEE
I'm gonna... have to... just...
28) LEE
[cough]
210) LEE
[sigh, ah well. so it goes.]
373) KENNY
[takes a glug of whiskey]
375) LEE
[glug of whiskey]
379) CHRISTA
[taking a swing of whiskey]
29) CHRISTA
{FearA} Hey...
197) OMID
{ThinkingA} Hey!
353) LEE
{NormalB} Hey!
30) CHRISTA
{NormalA} You're not looking great. And you're warm.
31) 
Back off. I'm fine.
32) 
I'm okay. Don't worry.
33) 
Don't turn on me. I'm okay.
34) LEE
{NormalC} Back off, I'm --
35) LEE
{NormalB} I'm okay, don't --
36) LEE
{NormalD} Hey, don't star--
37) CHRISTA
{NormalB} I'm sure you're--
38) CLEMENTINE
[radio process hushed] Lee, Lee, Lee, I'm okay, I'm where my parents-- oh no!
41) CLEMENTINE
[sfx processed that turns to just straight radio voice like the other branch] Lee! Lee! Lee! I'm okay, I'm where my parents-- oh no!
39) CLEMENTINE
[sfx processed]  Lee.
40) CLEMENTINE
[sfx processed] Lee.
42) CHRISTA
{AngryB} We need SOLUTIONS, {FearA} not stupid jokes.
43) CHRISTA
[apologizing for the tone she just took.] {SadA} I'm sorry.
149) 
I'm sorry.
153) LEE
{NormalD} I'm sorry.
306) CHRISTA
{SadA} I'm sorry.
44) KENNY
{ThinkingA} So, no ideas, then.
45) CHRISTA
{AngryA} OMID.
46) OMID
{AngryA} CHRISTA. I'm just trying to lighten the fucking tone.
47) CHRISTA
{NormalB} Knock it off.
48) OMID
{HappyA} Dixon Kent the III, industri--
49) OMID
{HappyB} I bet this guy would.
50) OMID
{HappyA} He's got a resourceful air about him.
51) KENNY
{ThinkingA} Anyone have any ideas?
52) CHRISTA
[urgent] {FearA} What did that mean?
53) LEE
[pickup1] [re-record -- BIG BIG REALIZATION, not so urgent] {NormalB} She's at the hotel where her parents were staying; {HappyA} he hasn't moved her.
54) KENNY
{AngryA} Yet.
55) CHRISTA
{FearA} Yeah, yet.
56) 
We have to go, NOW.
57) 
Stop. We can't panic.
59) BEN
{FearA} Lee, get up!
60) KENNY
{FearA} Did you hear that?
61) LEE
{NormalC} Yeah, I did.
62) 
Seriously, why the fuck did we come up here?
63) 
Keep looking for a way out!
64) 
I'll fight my way out ALONE, then.
65) LEE
[frustrated]{FearA} We have to go, NOW. {NormalC} Like right this goddamn minute.
66) KENNY
[emp] {ThinkingA} WHERE, Lee? Come on! We're trapped.
67) LEE
[frustrated] {NormalC} Stop it. We can't panic.
68) LEE
[frustrated]{NormalC} We shouldn't have come up here. {NormalD} We're trapped.
69) CHRISTA
{AngryA} Calm down.
73) CHRISTA
{AngryA} Calm down.
70) KENNY
{FearA} Lee's right.
71) LEE
[frustrated]{NormalB} Like I said, everyone needs to{NormalC} keep looking for a way out, dammit. {NormalD} We're trapped in here.
72) LEE
[frustrated]	{AngryA} I guess I'll fight my way out ALONE, then.
74) LEE
[frustrated]{AngryB} Don't tell me to calm down. {FearA} We're trapped, dammit!
75) KENNY
{ThinkingA} Lee's right, Christa.
76) KENNY
{ThinkingA} We need to start thinking about more than just Clementine when it comes to{AngryA} our... urgency.
77) OMID
{ThinkingA} What do you mean?
78) KENNY
{NormalB} How do we get out of here?
79) OMID
{NormalB} That's the whole point; we don't know.
80) KENNY
[more urgent] {ThinkingA} Okay, now your life depends on it. {AngryA} How do you get out of here?
81) OMID
{DisgustA} I don't know.{ThinkingA} I don't get it.
82) CHRISTA
{FearA} I do.
83) KENNY
{FearA} How long do you think we have?
84) LEE
{ThinkingA} What? {FearA} I... I don't know.
85) LEE
{NormalD} I thought about cutting it off, {NormalC}but I didn't.
86) KENNY
{ThinkingA} We should've cut it off. {FearA} At least then there would've been a chance.
87) LEE
{NormalC}Well, you didn't and it's too late now.
88) CHRISTA
{FearA} We should've made you take it off.
89) BEN
{FearA} Maybe I should've made you cut it off...
90) KENNY
{ThinkingA} You could've cut it off?!
91) BEN
{SadA} Yeah. There were tools. {FearA} Lee didn't want to.
92) KENNY
{ThinkingA} Do you think that worked?
93) LEE
{NormalC} I... I don't know. {NormalD} I hope so.
94) KENNY
{ThinkingA} I think we need to have... an "adult" conversation about {FearA} what happens if Lee takes another spill.
95) KENNY
{ThinkingA} We could be looking at a Larry situation here.
96) CHRISTA
{DisgustA} Who's Larry?
97) KENNY
{AngryA} It don't matter.
98) OMID
{SickA} Hey, look...
99) OMID
{ThinkingA} He looks fine to me... [nervous]
100) 
We don't need to talk about it.
109) LEE
{NormalC} We don't need to talk about it.
101) 
Let's worry about Clem.
102) 
Fine; what do you want to do?
103) 
Thanks a fucking lot.
104) 
My arm is not the issue.
105) 
What if it was DUCK out there?
106) 
Then just kill me!
107) 
You're not touching me.
108) 
I'm sorry! Okay?!
110) KENNY
{ThinkingA} I think we do.
111) LEE
{AngryA} I said we don't.
112) CHRISTA
{FearA} GUYS.
113) LEE
{NormalC} Okay, what do you want to do?
114) KENNY
{FearA} Just... talk about it.
115) LEE
{AngryB} Does that conversation end with me getting something dropped on my head?
116) KENNY
{AngryB}Now HEY--
117) CHRISTA
{ThinkingA} I don't know what happened before Omid and I showed up, {FearA} but we can cross this bridge when we get to it.
118) KENNY
{FearA} Lee, I'm not advocating anything here...
119) KENNY
{ThinkingA} But how is this not a thing? {FearA}We're all so worked up about Clementine that {AngryA} we're forgetting what the fuck happened to you!
120) LEE
{NormalC} I'm really glad I've got you looking out for me, for Clem. {AngryA} This is just fucking great.
121) KENNY
{AngryB} Relax, Lee.[getting pissed]
122) LEE
{AngryC} My arm is not the issue. I'm not the problem. The five hundred walkers in the house and no door in this room {AngryA} are the goddamn PROBLEM.
123) LEE
{ThinkingB} What if it was you and it was Duck out there?
124) KENNY
{AngryB} Whoa there, friend.
125) LEE
{NormalD} I bet you'd rather stay focused on the problem {AngryB} and not have people turn on you.
126) OMID
{DisgustA} This is getting out of hand...
127) KENNY
{AngryC} Because I haven't given up {AngryB} EVERYTHING to die because we were stupid.
128) KENNY
{AngryC} You're gonna listen to ME.
129) KENNY
{AngryB} We will get Clementine back, with or without you.
130) LEE
{AngryC} Then kill me, you son of a bitch, okay? {AngryD} Don't even fucking hesitate.
131) KENNY
{AngryC} I WILL.
132) LEE
{AngryB} I'm sorry, okay! {AngryC} Fuck! We can't do this!
133) KENNY
{AngryB} We're going to have to!
134) LEE
[throwing a heavy thing in anger] GRRAH!
135) KENNY
[throwing a heavy thing in anger] GRRAH!
136) OMID
{NormalB} You ruined that dude's face.
137) CHRISTA
{NormalB} Shut up, sweetie. {FearA} Look.
138) KENNY
{HappyA} It's corroded to hell.
139) CHRISTA
{ThinkingA} What's on the other side of this wall, a thirty foot drop?
140) OMID
{ThinkingA} No, this mansion butts up against the one next door.
141) KENNY
{HappyA} If the rest is as dilapidated as this, we might not have to.
142) CHRISTA
{FearA} We're not lifers on Alcatraz here; {ThinkingA} we can't spend the next three months digging through a wall.
143) KENNY
[this could be a good idea] {HappyB} I'll be damned.
144) KENNY
{ThinkingA} Let's see...
145) KENNY
{HappyA} Yeah. We can do this.
146) KENNY
[semi to himself] We have to work fast.
147) LEE
[relieved] {HappyA} Okay.
148) KENNY
{NormalB} We'll work in shifts. Omid, Christa and I. {ThinkingA} Lee, you rest.
150) 
Don't come near me with that thing.
154) LEE
{AngryA} Don't come near me with that thing.
151) 
I wasn't going to hurt you.
156) LEE
{NormalD} I wasn't going to hurt you.
152) KENNY
{SadA} Me too. {NormalC} I get it. Go sit down.
155) KENNY
[sincere] {NormalB} Sure, pal. I know.
157) LEE
{HappyA} This wall ain't shit.
158) OMID
{ThinkingA} Is this really possible...?
159) CHRISTA
We probably would've let you go alone if you hadn't told us. {FearA} Which would've been a mistake.
160) CHRISTA
{NormalA} I'm glad you told us when you got bitten, it would've been easy not to.
161) LEE
{NormalD} Yeah, well...
162) CHRISTA
I can't believe you didn't tell us you were bitten.
163) 
I didn't want to scare anyone.
166) LEE
I didn't want to scare anyone.
164) 
You couldn't do anything anyway.
173) LEE
You couldn't do anything anyway.
165) 
It was my business.
177) LEE
It was my business.
167) CHRISTA
Because you were scared yourself.
168) LEE
I'd been bitten by a walker.
169) CHRISTA
You thought we'd turn on you.
170) LEE
Sure. [sure, why wouldn't you]
383) 
Sure.
171) CHRISTA
I'm sure that's what that Larry guy or whoever said.
172) LEE
He wasn't bitten. It was different.
174) CHRISTA
No. Except make sure Clementine had someone coming for her that wasn't liable to die on the way there.
175) LEE
I wasn't going to let that happen.
176) CHRISTA
Not ours? Not Clementine's?
178) CHRISTA
Well, it was a dumb thing to do. Omid and I have shown you who we are. You could've trusted us.
179) CHRISTA
You were scared. I don't blame you.
180) OMID
I would be scared shitless.
181) 
Figure out who he is. Why he did it.
182) 
We just get Clementine. Nothing else.
183) OMID
{DisgustA} If I were you I would've been scared shitless.
184) 
I was.
185) 
I am.
193) LEE
{NormalD} I am.
186) 
If you were me you'd be a foot taller.
198) LEE
{HappyA} If you were me you'd be a foot taller.
187) LEE
{NormalD} I was. {NormalC} The fucking thing... {FearA} it happened so fast. {ThinkingA} You ever almost hit someone in a crosswalk?
188) OMID
{HappyA} Almost...?
189) CHRISTA
{HappyA} His license was suspended. {ThinkingA} Twice.
190) LEE
{NormalC} Just... {SurpriseA} WHAM, the {NormalC} thing was on me. Never saw it; like someone in your blindspot.
191) LEE
{NormalD} I panicked. {SadA} But now... I just feel it inside me. Like the day before you get the flu.
192) OMID
{SadA} That's horrible.
194) OMID
{DisgustA} And when it happened?
195) LEE
{NormalB} And about fifty pounds heavier. {HappyA} You, uh, wouldn't get scared as much. [with a wink]
196) OMID
{HappyA} With your arm and my leg, {ThinkingA} I'll cripple fight you right here, buddy.
199) LEE
{HappyA} I would've had to chop this one off for {ThinkingA} you to even stand a chance.
200) LEE
{HappyA} I've still got this one. I can put my right palm on your forehead and{HappyC} just let you swing away.
201) OMID
{HappyA} Ha, fine... you win, jerk.
202) CHRISTA
{HappyA} I don't know, sweetie; {ThinkingA} you're scared shitless by so many little things that I like to think you {HappyA} triumph with the big ones.
203) OMID
{ThinkingA} Aww jeez, hon, thanks.
204) CHRISTA
{FearA} You wish you would've taken it off?
205) LEE
{NormalD} Don't think it matters much now.
206) LEE
I'm losing a lot of feeling in it.
207) OMID
[concerned] {SadA} Really?
208) LEE
{NormalC} Yeah. It's hot, like when you break a bone, {NormalD} but tingly like it's asleep.
209) OMID
{ThinkingA} So when we get this guy... {AngryA} what do you think?
211) CHRISTA
{SadA} You don't mean that.
212) CHRISTA
{FearA} What do you think the odds are of that?
213) LEE
{NormalD} I don't know. {NormalC} I know everyone's wondering. {NormalB} Even if it just slows down the process, I'd be happy.
214) CHRISTA
{DisgustA} It's so weird; I keep doing a double-take on your arm, expecting it to be there.
215) LEE
{NormalD} I'm hoping whatever's in their bite is gone too.
216) 
We make sure he never does it again.
217) LEE
{NormalC} We'll do whatever it takes.
218) LEE
{NormalB}We just get Clementine; that's the focus. {NormalC} Despite how I might feel, {NormalD} I can't let vengeance be a thing.
219) OMID
{NormalB} Sure, but if it's not that easy...
220) LEE
{ThinkingA} Is it possible to have survived and not gotten into some shit?
221) LEE
{ThinkingA} We figure out who he is and {ThinkingB} why he's doing this; {NormalB} we can rescue Clem, {NormalD} but she won't be safe if this guy's not gonna stop.
222) OMID
{ThinkingA} Did your crew get into some shit before you met up with us?
223) LEE
{NormalC} We make sure he never takes anybody from anyone again. {NormalB} World's got enough evil in it.
224) OMID
{NormalB} ...Well, remember what I said, earlier. {AngryA} The guy should pay.
225) OMID
{NormalB} Well, I trust you'll do what's right.
226) OMID
{SadA} And...you know... {DisgustA} whatever happens to you... uh...
227) CHRISTA
{AngryA} Seriously, can we {SadA} not talk like that?
228) CHRISTA
{NormalB} The entire time we were at the hospital {SadA} I could sense you think you're as good as dead.
229) LEE
{NormalD} I'm bitten, Christa. {NormalC} We all know that's a wrap.
230) CHRISTA
{FearA} There's gotta be somethin'.
231) LEE
{NormalC} I haven't given up.
232) LEE
{NormalC} What good is it to plan around that workin'?
233) CHRISTA
{FearA} What good is it for you to give up?
234) LEE
{NormalD} I was bitten, Christa.
235) CHRISTA
{DisgustA} You cut it off.
236) 
I want you guys to take her.
240) LEE
{NormalD} I want you guys to take her.
237) 
I want Kenny to look after her.
246) LEE
{NormalD} I want Kenny to look after her.
238) 
Find a family for her, okay?
239) LEE
{NormalD} It's what I want. Okay?
241) CHRISTA
{SadA} Stop it.
247) CHRISTA
{SadA} Stop it.
242) LEE
{NormalC} I'm serious. {NormalB} She'd be safe and relatively happy with you two.
243) CHRISTA
{SadA} We're not doing this right now.
244) OMID
{NormalB} Christa.
255) OMID
{DisgustA}Christa.
245) OMID
{SadA} Listen to him.
248) LEE
{NormalC} Do you hear me?
249) OMID
{ThinkingA} Are you sure, man?
250) LEE
{NormalB} You didn't see him with his family. {NormalC} What he'd do to protect them.
251) LEE
{NormalD} Find her a family, okay? {NormalC} Somewhere she'll be safe.
252) CHRISTA
{DisgustA} Don't do this.
253) LEE
{NormalC} I want you to hear me.
254) CHRISTA
{FearA} I hear you, but I'm {AngryA} not having this conversation.
256) OMID
{HappyA} We could look after her.
257) LEE
{NormalB} As long as she has a family. You hear me?
258) OMID
{NormalB} Yeah. Of course. [solemn]
299) CHRISTA
{ThinkingA} Yeah, of course.
259) OMID
[staring a new subject] {HappyA} We'll make sure she's safe, Lee. {NormalB} If that's what you're worried about.
260) CHRISTA
{SadA} He's not. {AngryA} We're not having that conversation yet.
261) OMID
{ThinkingA}What about him?
262) 
He'll figure himself out.
263) 
What do you think?
264) 
We gotta support him.
265) LEE
{NormalB} He'll figure himself out one way or another.
266) CHRISTA
{ThinkingA} What do you mean by that?
267) LEE
{NormalC} He'll either get his act together or {NormalD} something'll happen to him.
268) CHRISTA
{DisgustA} That's it?
269) LEE
{NormalB} What else is there to say?
270) LEE
{ThinkingA} What do you two think?
271) CHRISTA
{ThinkingA} He's a risk to the group, but--
272) OMID
{SadA} I feel bad for him.
273) CHRISTA
{SadA} Yeah, I feel bad for him, too.
274) LEE
{NormalB} We gotta support him. He's only a kid still; {NormalD} it's easy to forget that.
275) CHRISTA
{SadA} Poor kid. {ThinkingA} Even if he's a bit of a dumbass.
276) CHRISTA
{NormalB} It's good that he did; {AngryA} Kenny couldn't pull that shit on me.
277) OMID
{DisgustA} He lose his shit like that often?
278) LEE
{NormalB} No, that was a first.
279) 
The kid killed Kenny's family.
280) 
Kenny's been horrible to him.
281) 
He better not do it again.
282) LEE
{NormalB} Kenny's son got bitten during a raid by some gang that Ben was secretly helping. {NormalC} They used him. {NormalD} Kenny's wife... {NormalC} died because of their son.
283) CHRISTA
{SadA} Jesus...
284) LEE
{NormalD} The kid killed his family, {NormalB} so there's been some tension there.
285) OMID
{DisgustA} Really...? {ThinkingA} What happened?
286) LEE
{NormalC} Kenny's been horrible to him. {NormalB} He blames Ben for his family's death and... {NormalD} it's just more complicated than that.
287) OMID
{SadA} You do feel bad for him though, right?
288) LEE
{NormalB} He better not do it again. {NormalC} He ruined Kenny's life; outbursts like that aren't fucking appropriate.
289) OMID
{NormalB} Well, it seems like it got through to Kenny. {NormalA} Whatever that's good for.
290) OMID
{NormalB} Sure, if you don't count an infected leg.
291) CHRISTA
{NormalB} You want me to do it?
292) OMID
{NormalA} Nah, hon, you can hop in after me.
293) KENNY
[tired from exertion] {NormalB} All right, I'm outta gas.
294) KENNY
[turns to omid] {ThinkingA} You look good and rested.
295) KENNY
[sitting down] Shouldn't be long now. It's good we're forced to take a breath.
296) KENNY
{SadA} I'd have done the same thing.
297) KENNY
{ThinkingA} Took some brass. {SadA} I don't think I woulda.
298) KENNY
{ThinkingA} Heard you guys giving Lee some hell about hiding his bite.
300) CHRISTA
{ThinkingA} At least he told us.
301) KENNY
{SadA} I still can't believe you went and got chomped. {AngryA} Just... fucking hell.
302) CHRISTA
[softens] {SadA} How are you?
303) KENNY
{SadC} Lee's family's gone, too.
304) CHRISTA
You've lost more than anyone.
305) KENNY
{ThinkingA} I'm... {SadC} I don't know how to answer that.
307) CHRISTA
{NormalB} Well, as much as anyone.
308) 
It'll be all right, Ken.
311) LEE
{NormalD} It'll be all right, Ken.
309) 
We don't need to get emotional.
317) LEE
{NormalC} We don't need to get emotional.
310) 
He's fine, okay?
321) LEE
{NormalC} He's fine, okay?
312) KENNY
[subject change] {NormalB} Anyway, I appreciate it, from both of you.{SadA}  A lot of us have lost families.
313) KENNY
{NormalB} Why you acting like what's happened {AngryA} ain't happened?
314) CHRISTA
{AngryA} I'm just asking him how he is.
315) KENNY
{NormalB} Lee's right. [dir looks over his shoulder] {ThinkingA} Your boyfriend's making decent progress; need to be ready to move.
316) CHRISTA
[sigh] {SadA} I agree. {FearA} I just wanted to say you've all lost a lot. {NormalB} We're still here, though.
318) KENNY
{NormalB} 'Preciate you askin' though.
319) CHRISTA
{AngryA} Chill. {NormalB} I know you want to get out of here. [dir: looks over] Omid's making good progress.
320) KENNY
{SadC} I am [emph] fine. [to christa] {SadB} I miss my family. That's all.
322) 
Maybe take it easy on him from now on.
323) 
You're right to hate him.
324) 
He wants to die.
325) KENNY
{FearA} Maybe. {AngryA} Maybe not.
326) LEE
{NormalB} Not at him.
327) KENNY
{AngryA} I'm angry as hell.
328) LEE
{NormalD} Maybe take it easy on him from here on out.
329) LEE
{NormalB} You're right to hate him, you know?
330) KENNY
{AngryA} Maybe. {SadA} But what good's it doin'? {SadC} I'm not getting them back.
331) KENNY
{NormalB} Yeah. [flat]We all are.
332) CHRISTA
{NormalB} He's having a rough go.
333) KENNY
{ThinkingA} I'm glad it was you making that call and not me.
334) KENNY
{NormalB} What's that now? [intimate]
335) KENNY
{SadA} Ah, Jesus... [to himself]
336) KENNY
[sigh] {NormalB} Ah, well. [to himself, coming back to earth]
337) CHRISTA
{ThinkingA} Bits and pieces.
338) KENNY
{ThinkingA} This guy tell you much about what we been through?
339) KENNY
{NormalC} Before ya'll we had this woman, {ThinkingA} Lilly, with us. Lord knows where she is now. {NormalB} Anyway, we had to... {FearA} make some tough calls with her dad. {NormalB} She came between Lee and I pretty good, and I spent a lot of nights {ThinkingA} hating this guy's [gestures towards lee] guts.
340) LEE
{NormalD} What? [intimate]
341) KENNY
{NormalB} I did. [sad] {SadA} I never really thought about it that way.
342) LEE
{NormalD} You heard him outside.
343) KENNY
The day I met him, {AngryA} I thought this guy was a pretty big piece of shit.
344) CHRISTA
{ThinkingA} Has much changed?
345) KENNY
{NormalB} Yeah, it did. {SadB} My family's... gone. {SadC} But I know I could feel even more alone.
346) KENNY
{NormalB} It would turn me into a monster, but I {SadA} wish my boy was sitting {SadB} alive in a room somewhere.
347) KENNY
{SadA} No, not really. But,{NormalB} Lee....
348) LEE
{NormalC} Yeah?
349) KENNY
{NormalB} I haven't agreed with you much, but {ThinkingA} everything you're doing to get Clem? We see eye to eye on that.
350) KENNY
{NormalB} See that lump on his face?
351) KENNY
[regretful] {SadA} Might'a.
352) CHRISTA
{ThinkingA} You did that?
354) KENNY
{HappyA} Soft as rotten fruit.
355) CHRISTA
{ThinkingA} Like you guys didn't have enough problems without punching each other in the face?
356) KENNY
{NormalB} Eh, he had to knock some sense into me before we met you on the train.
357) KENNY
{HappyA} Well, he can't fight for shit.
358) CHRISTA
[sarc] {HappyA} Well, look at him.
359) KENNY
{NormalC} We were resourceful.
360) CHRISTA
{FearA} Larry didn't make it out?
361) KENNY
{NormalB} No, he did not. We did though.
362) KENNY
{ThinkingA} The aforementioned "Larry" fella? {NormalB} See, Lee and I got trapped in a fucking meat locker with him. {ThinkingA} He had a heart attack. So there's this guy who, {AngryA}I should say, was built like a brick shithouse, and we're{FearA} terrified he's gonna come back and eat all of us.
363) CHRISTA
{ThinkingA} What'd you do?
364) 
Water under the bridge.
365) 
Eh, you're still a bastard.
366) 
I'm sorry for any pain I caused.
367) LEE
{NormalB} It's all water under the bridge. {NormalD} All we can do is move forward.
368) LEE
{NormalB} After everything, you're still a {NormalC} bastard, you know, Ken?
369) KENNY
{NormalC} Been hearing that my whole life, doc.
370) LEE
{NormalD} I'm sorry for hurting you in any way, Kenny. {NormalC} It's impossible to go through life without causing some sorta pain{ThinkingA} but sometimes I can't help but wonder if {SadA} I coulda caused a little less.
371) KENNY
{SadA} You and me both, doc.
372) CHRISTA
{NormalB} And you're both here now, trying to help each other.
374) KENNY
{SadA} Well, cheers.
376) LEE
{NormalB} Nah.
384) 
Nah.
377) KENNY
[alt use if acting doesn't cover] {ThinkingA} Suit yourself.
378) OMID
[offscreen, cardio] {HappyA} I'm through!
380) OMID
{HappyA} No walkers.
381) OMID
{HappyB} Things are looking up.

385) 
Coat Rack
386) 
Wall
387) LEE
[pickup1] [grimace]
388) KENNY
[pickup1] [doubtful] {SadA} That, uhh... {ThinkingA}feelin' any better?
389) KENNY
[pickup1] {ThinkingA} I'm not insinuatin' you're a {NormalC}damn super hero.
390) LEE
[pickup1] {NormalC} What the hell do you think, Kenny? [not too mean]
391) 
What the hell do you think?
392) 
Still feels... "recently chopped."
393) LEE
[pickup1] {NormalD} Still feels pretty recently chopped. {NormalC} So, no, Kenny. {ThinkingB} It feels 'bout as good as you'd expect.
394) 
I can handle it.
395) LEE
[pickup1] {NormalD} I can handle it; {NormalC} the pain, that is. {NormalD} I'm just really goddamn tired.
396) KENNY
[pickup1] {ThinkingA} I don't expect you to say you're fit as a fiddle.
397) LEE
[pickup1] {NormalC} I feel like a man who got bitten. So{NormalD} take that for what it's worth.
398) KENNY
[pickup1] {NormalC} I mean, do you think{ThinkingA}  it worked?  {SadA} Did it- did it help at all?
399) LEE
[pickup1] {AngryA} That isn't going to happen.
400) LEE
[pickup1] {NormalC} I think it'd be best if we just worried about getting to Clem right now.
401) KENNY
[pickup1] {DisgustA} How do you know that?
402) KENNY
[pickup1] {ThinkingA} We're not gonna do her any good if {AngryA}you've attacked us.
403) KENNY
[pickup1] {AngryA} yeah, maybe at the moment... but {ThinkingA}who's to say when it becomes an issue.  And at that point, {AngryB}there may not be any time left to deal with it!
404) KENNY
[pickup1][responding to lee's steely calm but you break]{AngryC}  You might become one of them. {AngryB} Do you understand that? {AngryD} How can you be fucking calm about that!
405) LEE
[pickup1] {AngryA} I said, do you hear me?
406) LEE
[pickup1] [steely calm] {AngryB} You're not touching me. {AngryA} Do you understand that? {AngryB} You know EXACTLY what to do if I turn and that's enough. {AngryC} Do you hear me?
407) BEN
[pickup1] {SadB} Here, um... {FearA}I'm not good with these. {NormalB}You dropped it down there.
408) LEE
[pickup1] {NormalD} He wanted to die... in Crawford.
409) LEE
[pickup1] {NormalC} When I had them there... in my hand. {NormalD} He wanted me to drop him. {NormalC} He asked me to.
