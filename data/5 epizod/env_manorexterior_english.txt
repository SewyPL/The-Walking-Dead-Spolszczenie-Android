47) KENNY
{surprisedA}Rethink?! How {disgustA}about we just THINK for once.

78) KENNY
CHILL? {surprisedA}Lee's bitten and God {disgustA}knows how long HE has left, {surprisedA}Clementine is, {angryB}who the fuck knows and we're {angryC}robbed of the only hope we've had.
79) BEN

92) BEN
{angryB}NO! You {surprisedA}know how they {disgustA}died. You've said {sadE}GOODBYE. I never {sadC}got to see my family, my parents, my {sadD}little sister... do you get that? Your {fearB}family is gone, but {sadA}at least you had them to lose.
93) BEN
{disgustA}I never made it home. They could be {fearB}alive or {sadE}dead or {sadC}walkers or {surprisedA}WORSE and {angryB}I DON'T KNOW. SO {angryC}GIVE ME A FUCKING BREAK.
94) KENNY

101) CHRISTA
[pssh, whatever] You wouldn't have had a boat to lose {fearA}without us, so {angryA}shove it, okay?
102) CHRISTA
{thinkingA}What do you think, Lee, what {fearA}do we do now, without a boat?
112) KENNY
{angryA}What, you got the boat hidden somewhere?
113) KENNY
{angryB}Well, I know you two are just going to look out for number one. [awk] {thinkingA}And number {disgustA}two, you {angryB}know, yourselves.

{thinkingA}At least Lee's thinking. You're {angryA}goddamn right we get another boat.
122) OMID
{disgustA}Aren't we all missing the {fearA}point right now? Clementine is the {angryA}goal. That's it.
123) CHRISTA
{angryA}But not here.
124) KENNY
{angryA}This is bullshit; he {fearB}might not even be around, so -- {sadA}with all due respect, Lee -- his {thinkingA}opinion doesn't carry a lot of weight.
125) CHRISTA
{thinkingA}Look, we know what Lee thinks.
126) CHRISTA
{thinkingA}[to Lee, closer] Get out of town at {disgustA}least, right?
127) CHRISTA
Hey. It's {fearA}still his little girl out there. {disgustA}She's number one. That's the {angryA}end of that, okay?

159) OMID
{disgustA}Wait, the {sadA}cancer patients did this?
132) KENNY
{disgustA}Yeah, they were waiting. {thinkingA}Tired of living underground, I guess. They kicked the {surprisedA}shit out of {angryA}me and tossed me in here.
160) KENNY

{thinkingB}I thought it might buy me some time; {fearA}you know, get that bite off my body and {normalD}hopefully whatever is gonna happen takes longer.
143) LEE
{disgustB}I thought it might save my life. I {normalB}was lucky to get bit down on the wrist, {thinkingB}far from anything important. {normalD}But who knows.
144) LEE
{disgustB}I passed out and realized the {normalC}bite was just going to slow me down. {thinkingB}I might still be fucked, but {fearA}honestly I feel better.

148) 
It's definitely having an impact.
149) 
I'm fine, it's no big deal.
150) 
It comes in waves.
151) LEE
{thinkingB}It's definitely having an impact. {disgustB}I passed out a couple times. Just {thinkingA}feeling like shit in general. But {fearA}I've got time. {normalD}Let's not worry about it.
152) LEE
{disgustB}I'm fine; what's {normalC}done is done. We {thinkingB}have to focus on finding Clementine.
153) LEE
{thinkingB}It comes in waves. I {fearA}took a couple spills {normalD}getting back here, so keep an eye on me.
161) BEN
