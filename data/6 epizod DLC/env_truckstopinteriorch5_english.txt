1) BECCA
{NormalB}Cool. [matter of routine]{NormalA}[to Shel]You check the flashlights this time, {NormalB}I'll look over the guns.
2) BECCA
[Her sister is staring at her lovingly]{ThinkingB}What?
3) SHEL
[lovingly]{HappyC}Nothing.
4) SHEL
[pickup2][about the soup - to herself]{HappyC}{Body-A}Smells good.
5) SHEL
{DisgustB}No. {ThinkingB}Roman said it was like this when he and Stephanie found the place. {DisgustB}Could be anything these days, though.
6) BECCA
{ThinkingB}Did you ever find out what happened there?
7) SHEL
[reasuring]{HappyC}We will. {HappyA}One day.
8) BECCA
{NormalA}It'd be nice to get those windows fixed one day.
9) BECCA
{NormalA}How's Joyce today?
10) SHEL
{HappyC}She seems good. {NormalA}Clive's watching over her... {ThinkingB}as usual. [afterthought]{DisgustB}Talk about survivors... {SadA}those guys have been through a lot.
11) SHEL
[to herself, looking at shelves of canned food] {ThinkingB}I don't miss going on raids for this stuff.
12) SHEL
[sad.  Seeing a puppy being eaten by zombies] [under her breath(on exhale)]{FearC}Oh, God.
13) SHEL
[to herself, wondering what the other zombies are doing?] {ThinkingA}Hmm... what's going on with her?
14) SHEL
[startled!] {FearB}Ahh!  [catching her breath]{AngryB}Gah! You scared me!
15) SHEL
[mild sniffing and whimpering as she stars to tear up.]{FearC}
16) SHEL
[alt][mild sniffing and whimpering as she stars to tear up.][to herself]{FearC}...That's so sad.
17) SHEL
[watching zombies eat.  It saddens and disguts her]{DisgustB}...Ugh.
18) BECCA
{HappyC}[laughing after scaring her sister!] Hahahahaa!!
19) SHEL
[A little too harsh, angry!]{AngryC}Gah! Jesus! Don't {AngryD}ever fucking do that again!
20) BECCA
{SurpriseA}Woah!  {DisgustB}What's your problem?  {ThinkingB}I do this all the time and you don't get all {DisgustB}pissed off!
21) BECCA
{ThinkingA}[popping out and scaring her sister!]Raaaaarrrr!!!!
22) SHEL
[Frightened scream!] {FearD}Aaaaaahhhh!!!
23) BECCA
{DisgustB}But...
24) SHEL
[stern]{AngryC}{ThinkingA}You just... {AngryA}you can't go jumping out at people. {AngryB}Not any more. {AngryC}It's not safe.
25) BECCA
{FearA}What are you talking about?
26) SHEL
{AngryB}What if I had a weapon?  {AngryC}I could have thought you were a walker!
27) SHEL
[apologetic for snapping at her sister] {SadA}I'm sorry. {DisgustB}It's just... the watch dogs... {SadB}I guess they found a puppy....[trails off sadly]
28) SHEL
[sad]{SadB}I saw the guard dogs eating a... a puppy. {DisgustB}I guess it just got to me.
29) BECCA
{FearA}Are you all right, sis?
30) SHEL
{FearC}[heavy breathing after being startled]...Oh, God....
31) BECCA
{DisgustB}Bad time?  {ThinkingB}What's up?
32) SHEL
[catching her breath] {DisgustB}Yeah... I just... {SadA}you caught me at a bad time, {DisgustB}that's all.
33) SHEL
[sad]{SadA}Yeah. {DisgustB}I guess it just... {ThinkingA}it got to me, ya know. {FearA}It was so little. {SadA}You don't think about babies any more, but.... {SadB}After a while you just kind of accept... {DisgustB}this is it.
34) SHEL
[sad. Cont.][chuckles a bit at the irony]{SadA}But then... {DisgustB}you know... {SadB}there it is. {ThinkingA}You see it and you want to protect it. {DisgustA}[clears throat]...{DisgustB}And now it's gone.
35) BECCA
{ThinkingB}A puppy?
36) SHEL
[flustered] {AngryB}I... {ThinkingA}{SadA}look, I just saw our walkers out back {SadB}eating a puppy.
37) 
It's not safe to go jumping out at people!
38) 
I'm sorry. I just saw something sad...
39) 
Just leave me alone!
40) SHEL
[pickup2 - (For localization; line edited)]{ThinkingA}It's the walkers... {SadB}and I guess they got ahold of a puppy.
41) BECCA
{AngryB}Dude, what the {ThinkingB}hell?  {DisgustB}If something's wrong, tell me about it.
42) SHEL
[sharp]{AngryA}Just leave me alone!  {ThinkingA}I don't want to talk about it right now.
43) BECCA
{NormalA}[bluntly practical]Maybe if Clive dies next we can put him out there instead. {NormalB}He'd make a better watch dog anyway.
44) BECCA
[not really getting why it's sad]{AngryA}That sucks. [short pause]
45) SHEL
[sad, almost a whisper, not sure how her sister became so detached from emotion.]{SadB}Becca....
46) BECCA
{NormalB}{NormalA}Yeah. {NormalB}I guess you kinda forget.
47) SHEL
{HappyC}{Body-A}Cool.
48) SHEL
[with a smile]{HappyC}Uh, no, I don't think so! {HappyA}You just make sure those flashlights are all working. {HappyC}We don't want anyone getting stuck in the dark!
49) BECCA
{AngryA}Yeah, {NormalB}that would suck.
50) SHEL
[slightly stern]{NormalA}Nuh-uh. I don't want you messing with those unless we're in danger, okay? {HappyA}I'll take care of those later.
51) BECCA
[disappointed] {AngryB}Fine.
52) SHEL
{NormalA}Okay, but be careful. {SadA}People's lives depend on those. {HappyA}We can't have them screwing up because we got lazy.
53) BECCA
[in a joking tone]{NormalA}No?  {AngryA}Fine. {AngryB}Flashlights it is.
54) 
Cool.
55) 
I don't think so!
56) 
Okay, but be careful.
57) 
I don't want you messing with those.
58) SHEL
[Shel remembers she wanted to do someting else]{HappyA}Actually, {HappyB}I wanted to make sure our blades were in good condition first. {HappyA}No rush on the flashlights.
59) SHEL
{ThinkingB}Remember the dead ones Roman found when we first got here?  {NormalA}This is where they were. {DisgustB}Might have been just sitting in here for months, who knows.

71) SHEL
[pickup1] {ThinkingB}I don't know yet.
72) ROMAN
[pickup1] [getting ready to feed the zombies]{ThinkingA}He's hungry!  {HappyA}I guess he knows it's feeding time!
73) 
He's not an animal.
74) SHEL
[pickup1]{ThinkingA}He's not an animal, Roman.
75) 
I feel bad for it.
76) SHEL
[pickup1]{SadA}I feel bad for it.
77) 
It's disgusting.
78) SHEL
[pickup1]{ThinkingA}It's disgusting.
79) ROMAN
[pickup1]{NormalC}Well, it's not human either. {SadA}Not anymore.
80) ROMAN
{NormalB}Yeah, well... {ThinkingA}at least we found a way for 'em to be useful.
81) ROMAN
[pickup1]{DisgustA}Can't disagree with you there.
82) ROMAN
{NormalA}[pickup1][putting the feeding bucket on the ground]You know, {NormalB}your sister said she wouldn't mind doing this.
83) SHEL
[pickup1] {ThinkingA}I don't know. {ThinkingB}I'll check it out.
84) ROMAN
{NormalA}[pickup1]I gotta get back out front. [smiles]{HappyA}Looking forward to that soup!
85) ROMAN
{DisgustA}[pickup1]What's that one eatin'?
86) ROMAN
{ThinkingA}[pickup1]Okay. [She'll have to deal with it one day]
87) SHEL
[pickup1][talking to a zombie, wathing it eat] {ThinkingB}That's so gross.
88) SHEL
[pickup1][talking to a zombie] {ThinkingA}Try not to make a mess out here.
89) SHEL
[pickup1][to herself, remembering]{FearA}Oh, {ThinkingA}crap! I told Roman I'd see what she got a hold of!
90) SHEL
[pickup1]Yeah, in a sec.
91) BECCA
[pickup2][friendly]That's because they used to PAY people to clean it.
92) SHEL
[pickup2][look at - Old Diner Photos - To becca]{HappyA}{Body-A}The diner looked pretty nice back then.
93) SHEL
[pickup2][look at - stove]{NormalA}{Body-A}I still can't believe Clive got this thing working. {HappyC}So much nicer than having to eat raw food all the time.
94) SHEL
[pickup2][look at - lights]{ThinkingA}{Body-A}Next time we venture out for supplies I gotta remember to look for light bulbs, too.
95) SHEL
[pickup2][look at - Soda Tap]{DisgustA}{Body-A}This hasn't worked in a long time.

97) SHEL
[pickup2][look at - Fire Extinguisher]{NormalA}{Body-A}We should do an inspection on these... {ThinkingA}make sure they all work.
98) SHEL
[pickup2][look at - sink]{SadA}{Body-A}I'm glad we thought to bottle our water before it ran out.
99) BECCA
[pickup2][joking]Oh, yeah! Then we can spend all our money at NOWHERE!
100) SHEL
[pickup2][look at - Cash register][joking]{HappyC}{Body-A}Hey, Becca, think we should start charging for the inspections we make?
101) SHEL
[pickup2][look at - missing painting]{ThinkingA}{Body-A}Looks weird in here without the paintings.
102) STEPHANIE
[pickup2]Well, Boyd wanted something to paint his own pictures on. I guess it'll be a personal gallery in here when he's done.
103) BECCA
{NormalA}[pickup2][bluntly practical]Maybe if Clive dies next we can put him out there instead. {NormalB}He'd make a better watch dog than those old people {NormalA}anyway.
104) BECCA
[pickup2][asking about the zombie eating the puppy]{ThinkingB}Was it the old man or the old woman? They're both kinda gross.

[pickup2][quietly, while becca plays guitar in the background/proud, because she taught her]	Hey, Shel, your sister's getting pretty good, huh?
116) SHEL
[pickup2][quietly, smiling, while becca plays guitar in the background]{HappyC}{Body-A}Becca had a good teacher, Stef. Thank you for doing that. She needs something to focus on besides... {SadA}you know... everything else.
117) STEPHANIE
[pickup2][quietly while Becca is playing guitar][knwoing that becca is losing her innocence]Yeah. Growing up in a world like this... what do you think that does to a kid?
118) 
I don't know.
119) 
She's already changing.
120) 
I'm trying to protect her.
121) SHEL
[pickup2][quietly]{SadA}{Body-A}I don't know. I know it's changed me... well, all of us. {SadB}But at this age for her... I don't know.
122) SHEL
[pickup2][quietly]{SadA}{Body-A}She's already changing. She dismisses things she cares about {SadB}so easily. {DisgustA}I guess you kinda have to when you've already lost so much, but {SadA}I still worry.
123) SHEL
[pickup2][quietly]{SadA}{Body-A}I'm trying to protect her from it as much as possible. {FearA}Things are stable here for now. {NormalA}I want her to grow up with THIS, not what's outside these walls.
124) STEPHANIE
[pickup2][quietly]Becca's a good kid. These are shit times and she's gonna go through that. But if we can keep her from experiencing some of the shit I've seen....
125) SHEL
[pickup2][quietly]{HappyC}{Body-A}Thanks, Stephanie.
126) ROMAN
[pickup2][to the group, friendly]Okay, let's get to it!
127) ROMAN
[pickup2][smiling] All right, all right. [transition to talking to the group]In that case, let's get back to work!
128) ROMAN
[pickup2][afterthought]Oh, and thanks to Boyd's hard work on the vegetable garden, we're having fresh soup tonight!
129) ROMAN
[pickup2]That was amazing, Becca! We could all use a little more music in our lives! Did I ever tell you that I used to play in a band?
130) STEPHANIE
[pickup2][joking around]Yes, Roman, you've told us! She doesn't want to hear about it AGAIN!
131) SHEL
[pickup2]{HappyD}Becca, that was great!
132) BECCA
[pickup2]Thanks, Sis! You think we can do something like this every week?
133) BECCA
[pickup2][shyly, with a smile, after playing guitar for the group]Thanks.
134) 
We'd need to get approval.
135) 
As long as it doesn't distract us.
136) 
That sounds like a great idea!
137) STEPHANIE
[pickup2][friendly] [to becca]You wanna help me and Shel do the supply inspection?
138) ROMAN
[pickup2]Shel, when you get a sec, meet me out back. Help me feed the watchdogs.
139) STEPHANIE
[pickup2]Still, better not to think about it.
140) STEPHANIE
[pickup2]They were both shot, but not in the head. Maybe whoever shot 'em didn't know about that yet.
141) STEPHANIE
[pickup2]Also, not as many dead visitors back then.
142) SHEL
[pickup2][friendly]{HappyA}{Body-A}If Roman approves it, I don't see why not. {HappyC}Seems like fun!
143) SHEL
[pickup2]{HappyB}{Body-A}As long as it doesn't distract from keeping this place safe. {NormalA}That's always the priority.
144) SHEL
[pickup2]{HappyD}{Body-A}That sounds like a great idea! {HappyC}Maybe we can all get in on it... like some kind of weekly talent show.
145) STEPHANIE
[pickup2]Don't worry about imposing on me! I'd love to keep teaching her how to play!
146) SHEL
[pickup2]{DisgustB}{Body-A}Sure thing.
147) SHEL
[pickup2][to herself] {DisgustA}{Body-A}It's starting to thin out in here. {SadA}Thank god we have a garden now.
148) 
It's better than the alternative.
149) 
This is far from an easy life.
150) 
I know, but it can wait.
151) ROMAN
[pickup2]Listen, I know you think that giving her an easy life is what's best, but it's really not.
152) SHEL
[pickup2]{ThinkingA}{Body-A}It's better than the alternative. {DisgustA}I'd rather she have a shorter happy experience in this world than one full of fear and death and horror.
153) SHEL
[pickup2]{SadB}{Body-A}This is far from an easy life, Roman.
154) SHEL
[pickup2]{SadA}{Body-A}Roman, we've talked about this. {NormalA}Becca doesn't need to deal with this kind of thing.
155) SHEL
[pickup2]{DisgustA}{Body-A}As long as she knows how to protect herself, it's fine. {SadA}I don't want her to stop caring about people.
156) ROMAN
[pickup2]You know what I mean. She needs to know the sacrifices we have to make to survive in this world.
157) SHEL
[pickup2][knowing it's true] {SadA}{Body-A}I know, I just {SadB}want her to have a little more time to be a kid.
158) ROMAN
[pickup2]I just don't want to see her get hurt, Shel.
159) STEPHANIE
[pickup2][something is very wrong! Panic]Shel, Becca! Something's going on outside!
160) BECCA
[pickup2][frightened] What is it?
161) STEPHANIE
[pickup2] [panic]I don't know. Something bad. We gotta find Roman!
162) SHEL
[pickup2][casual]{HappyA}{Body-A}You guys need help?
163) STEPHANIE
[pickup2] [friendly]Nah, we got this... right, Becca? You go ahead and help Roman out back.
164) SHEL
[pickup2][looking at - guns]{ThinkingA}{Body-A}How are we doing on ammo?
176) SHEL
[pickup2][looking at - guns]{ThinkingA}{Body-A}How are we doing on ammo?
165) STEPHANIE
[pickup2]Better than we thought. We haven't had to use these for a while.
177) STEPHANIE
[pickup2]Better than we thought. We haven't had to use these for a while.
166) BECCA
[pickup2]Don't worry. They're on our list.
167) SHEL
[pickup2][looking at - knives]{DisgustA}{Body-A}Ergh... these knives are looking pretty ragged.
168) STEPHANIE
[pickup2]Nope. Still in the cornfield somewhere I guess.
175) STEPHANIE
[pickup2]Nope. Still in the cornfield somewhere I guess.
169) SHEL
[pickup2][looking at - flashlights] {ThinkingA}{Body-A}Hmm... still one short. {DisgustA}We never found the other flashlight?
