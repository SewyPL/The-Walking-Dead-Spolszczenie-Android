{Body-Drive}{NormalA} You know, one time I was going out with this girl, right -- Abigail, you remember her -- and she told me that -- when she was five I think -- {HappyA} her dad took her to this circus sideshow.
64) WYATT
{NormalC}I think loading the gun is probably more important right this second, thanks.
65) WYATT
[under his breath]{NormalC}I don't care about this story.
66) WYATT

Man, fuck those guys! If that guy back there is alive we HAVE to help him, Wyatt. There ain't a lot of live dudes left these days.
98) WYATT
What if this "guy" is like the guys in the truck?
99) EDDIE
He ain't gonna be much of a threat after we bounced him off the hood!

102) WYATT
Why don't we just drive back?
275) 
Why don't we just drive back?
103) EDDIE
And maybe run him over again in the fog? He can't be that far back, man.
104) EDDIE
Find the guy and help him. Who the hell ARE you tonight?
105) WYATT
IF it's a guy.
106) EDDIE
[indignant] It's a guy. I saw him.
107) EDDIE
What else are we supposed to do, man? We can't just leave him.
108) WYATT
There's no way I'm getting out of this car. Forget it.
109) EDDIE
[angry] What if that was you, man?!? After all the shit that's happened in the past couple months? Where's your compassion, motherfucker?
110) EDDIE
We lost 'em, dude. We did the thing with the fucking headlights.
111) WYATT

116) EDDIE
[pickup2] Dude I JUST said there was a thing on the broken mirror.
117) EDDIE
{FearA} [pickup2] What's that way out in the road?
118) EDDIE
[pickup2] We should keep looking.

121) EDDIE
[pickup2] Just...fog.
122) EDDIE
[pickup2] {SadA}  Man, I'm really not seeing anything.
123) WYATT
[pickup2] I wish there was some way to tell.

129) EDDIE
{DisgustA}Want? {AngryA}Why would I want to? {FearB} I just... WE just have to. {ThinkingB}That's all there is to it.
130) EDDIE
{ThinkingB}I mean, I don't know... {SadA}Me? I hit the fucking guy. {FearB}One of us should stay here, though. In case.

{ThinkingB}I'm clear as shit, Wyatt. This is the only way it's fair.
139) WYATT
{AngryA}Fair? How is this fair? YOU shot that guy back there. YOU hit that thing in the road. {AngryB}None of that shit is my fault!
140) EDDIE
Wyatt, come on, man. If we can do it[rock/paper/scissors] over a girl, we can do it over this.
