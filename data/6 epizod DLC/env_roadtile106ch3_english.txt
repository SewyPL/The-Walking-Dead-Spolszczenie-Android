[worried] [mumbling to himself]{thinkinga}I got like sixty miles left... I think. Ain't shit.
2) RUSSELL
[urging himself on, trying not to be afraid] [mumbling to himself]{normala}I just gotta get there.
3) RUSSELL
{feara}I wasn't--
4) NATE
{thinkinga} Look, I don't care what you do to whatever corpse you find.
5) RUSSELL
{angrya} I won't--
6) NATE
{happya}Okay, so you have some balls on you just standing there like that. You'll get killed eventually; ain't none of my business.
7) NATE
{normalb} What's your name?
8) 
Russell.
11) RUSSELL
{normalb} Russell.
9) 
Asswipe.
13) RUSSELL
[indignant] {angrya}Asswipe.
10) 
Don't matter.
16) RUSSELL
{normalb}Don't matter.
12) NATE
So you didn't steal that bag.
14) NATE
[a little pissed] {angrya}I was gonna say you look like an Asswipe. Asswipe ain't got any manners. {thinkinga}Mom of Asswipe didn't teach him any manners. {normalb}But maybe she named you Russell and you didn't lose them manners 'til later in life.
15) NATE
{thinkinga}Unless you stole that bag.
17) NATE
{thinkinga}What, you don't like the name Russell?
18) NATE
{angrya}Or maybe that's just the name of the guy you or your homies robbed, huh?
19) NATE
{normala} Look, Russell, I just asked you your name, not who the King of fucking Norway was.
20) NATE
{thinkinga}But I might be being presumptuous. Maybe Russell is the name of the guy you took that bag from.
21) NATE
{thinkinga}I don't care who you steal from, if you did. Maybe you're in a gang that likes to rob people. I dunno.
22) NATE
{happya}Are you in a crew? You got some boys wearin' hoodies I gotta worry about?
23) NATE
{angrya}Because you steal from me and I'll get your throat out, I don't care who you run around with, you understand?
24) 
It's mine. I didn't steal it.
44) RUSSELL
{normala}It's mine, I didn't steal it.
25) 
I'm not in a gang.
26) 
Leave me alone.
27) RUSSELL
{angrya}Leave me alone.
28) NATE
{happya} ASSWIPE. AAAAAASSSSSSSSSSWIPE. Come on, man.
29) NATE
{happya}RUSSELL. RUSSSSELL. Come on, man.
30) NATE

32) NATE
[quick] {happya}Scoot.
33) NATE
[quick] {thinkinga}*tsk* Ain't gonna wait forever.

35) RUSSELL
[adjusting a pack on his shoulder. it digs in. hurts.][mumbling to himself] {normalb}Hmmph.
36) RUSSELL
[uncomfortable][mumbling to himself] {normala}Shouldn't'a maybe taken so many cans.
37) RUSSELL
{normala}It's getting late.
38) RUSSELL
[worried] {normala}Gotta find some place safe for when it gets dark.
39) RUSSELL
[to himself] {feara}I should 'prolly hurry.
40) RUSSELL
[to himself] {feara} Shit shit shit....
41) 
Okay. Yeah. I'd like a ride.
42) 
Nah, I'm good.
43) 
Will you take me to Statesboro?
95) RUSSELL
{feara}Will you take me to Statesboro?
45) NATE
{normala}All right, good. {angrya}I don't like thieves.
46) NATE
{normala}Hey now, I ain't no racist. I just call 'em like I see 'em.
47) RUSSELL
{angrya}I'm not in a gang. {disgusta}That's fucking racist, man.
48) RUSSELL
[grossed out by the smell of a rotting body]{disgusta} Ugh, yuck. Fucking gross, man...
49) 
[Stand your ground.]
50) 
[Hide.]
188) RUSSELL
[just escaped with your life]{surpriseb}
212) 
[Scream for help.]
51) 
I see anything weird, I'm runnin'.
52) 
Maybe I can get a ride.
53) 
This is stupid.
54) RUSSELL
[to himself, seeing an approaching truck and standing his ground] {normalb} I see anything weird, I'm runnin' my ass off.
55) RUSSELL
[to himself] {normala}Maybe this dude can give me a ride. {thinkinga}Maybe.
56) RUSSELL
[to himself] {angrya}This is fucking stupid. Fuck. I shoulda hid. Fuck.
57) NATE
{body-driveright}{disgusta}I see you cuddling with your girlfriend down there. Shit, bro.
58) NATE
{disgusta} I see you hiding down there with your boyfriend.
59) 
Damn.
63) RUSSELL
Damn...
60) 
Fuck you.
76) 
Fuck you.
61) 
I don't want no trouble.
77) 
I don't want no trouble.
62) NATE
{disgusta}That's gross, kid. {normala}Although I ain't gonna judge what you do with any dead body. However you get your kicks, you know.
64) NATE
{normalb}You gotta be careful, these ain't times to piss off a stranger.
205) NATE
{normalb}You gotta be careful, these ain't times to piss off a stranger.
65) NATE
{angrya}[dangerous] That ain't very fucking nice, kid.
203) NATE
{angrya}[dangerous] That ain't very fucking nice, kid.
66) RUSSELL
{angrya}Fuck you, man. Get outta here.
202) RUSSELL
{angrya}Fuck you, man. Get outta here.
67) RUSSELL
{angrya}I ain't no kid.
204) RUSSELL
{angrya}I ain't no kid.
68) RUSSELL
{feara}I don't want no trouble, please.
69) NATE
{thinkinga} You just wanna be left alone with your friend down there?
70) RUSSELL
{feara}No, just... leave me alone.
71) NATE
{thinkinga} Dude, I can see you breathing. And so can those dead dudes coming out of the woods.
72) NATE
{happya}HAHA, oh shit, man, how the fuck are you alive falling for junk like that?! {thinkinga} I mean SERIOUSLY, how are you not in some hillbilly's freezer already?!
73) NATE

75) NATE
{thinkingA} You're either stupid as fuck or think you're tough shit... or both, I guess.
78) 
I need a ride.
79) NATE
{normalb}Standing out here like this ain't gonna get you nothing but trouble.
80) RUSSELL
{normala}Just leave me alone, please... I'm not hurtin' no one.
81) NATE
[i'm not hurtin' no one]{thinkinga}How do I know that? {angrya}Maybe you're just walking this highway looking for some tail and gonna end up hurtin' somebody. Maybe killing you right now does our troubled country some good.
82) NATE
{normalb}But honestly, I ain't no do-gooder. I'm'a letcha live.
83) RUSSELL
{normalb} I need a ride. You got a ride.{feara}
84) NATE
{thinkinga}You willin' to work for it? I got needs. You know what I'm saying.
85) NATE
[breaking tension]{normalb}I'm just fucking with ya, man.
86) NATE
{thinkinga} Looks like both to me.
87) RUSSELL
{normalb}Okay. Yeah. {happya}I'd like a ride; that would be good, thanks.
88) NATE
{happyb}Hell, yeah! Get in; let's tear it up.
89) RUSSELL
{feara}I'mma tryin' to get to my Gran's house...
90) NATE
{happya}Fuck, she like to party? {normala}Just get in, we'll get there, or somewhere, eventually.
91) RUSSELL
{normalb}Nah, I'm good. Thanks. I don't want a ride.
92) NATE
{angrya}Jesus, don't be so damn sensitive.
93) RUSSELL
{angrya}I said I'm good.
94) NATE
{angryb}FINE.
96) NATE
{thinkinga}Uh, fuck, yeah, why not. Might get there the long way.
97) RUSSELL
{feara}God damn. Shit. Shit.

100) 
Sure.
113) 
Sure.
101) 
I don't want that shit.
108) RUSSELL
{angrya}I don't want that shit.
102) NATE
{thinkinga}You're not uptight are you? Because it's the fucking apocalypse; this is like, nothin'.
103) RUSSELL
{disgusta}No, I'm just good, all right?
105) NATE
{normala}All right, all right.
106) NATE
{angryb}This SHIT? You don't know what you're talkin' about. I damn near died procurin' this. {angrya}I got half a mind to make you try it.
107) RUSSELL
{angrya}You can't make me do anything.
109) NATE
{happya}Hahaha, okay tough guy. We both know that ain't true, but OKAY. Would do you some fucking good.
110) NATE
{thinkinga}That silent treatment shit makes a man think you're too good for what he's offerin'. {angrya}I don't like that. Not one bit.
111) NATE
{thinkinga}You want to tell me about where you come from at least? You must'a been with a crew.
112) NATE
{happya}Any tail back where you come from? Maybe drop you off and do a double-back.
114) 
No "tail."
115) 
Can we just drive?
124) RUSSELL
{feara} Can we just drive?
116) RUSSELL
{normalb}Sure, yeah. I mean, I'll tell you about who I was with.
117) RUSSELL
{normala}Ha, uh...{sada} okay.
118) NATE
{happya}Don't leave out any juicy deets, all right?
119) RUSSELL
[sigh] {sada}All right.
120) NATE
{thinkinga}Damn; I retract my question.
121) NATE
{normala}You're arguin' SEMANTICS, RUSS! {happya}Give a pal the deets.
122) RUSSELL
{normala}No, uh, "tail."
123) RUSSELL
{normala}There was a girl who I liked all right.
125) NATE
{thinkingb} We? You want to sit on my lap?
126) RUSSELL
{normalb} I just don't want to talk.
127) NATE
{thinkinga}You're a tough little nut, Russ.
128) NATE
[sigh] {thinkinga}Hmmph.
129) RUSSELL
{angrya}Steve was a bad dude, but everybody was with him, you know? {normalb} He said seven was the magic number, so we didn't add nobody to the group.
130) RUSSELL
{angrya}No, they DIDN'T.
131) NATE
{normalb}Let it out, Paco.
132) RUSSELL
{fearb}Just... "We gonna kill these folks and take their stuff or what?" and then bang, they'd be dead. {sada}Anyway... I couldn't handle that. After weeks of it, I packed my shit up and figured I can make for Gran's alone and try to find my family. [tough for him]
133) RUSSELL
{feara}If we found survivors it was the same every time. He... he...
134) RUSSELL
{disgusta}Leader was this guy, Steve.
135) NATE
{normala}So nobody got down with the daughter, then.
136) RUSSELL
{sada}There was seven of us. I didn't have any family there or nothing; they were all at my Gram's down in Statesboro.
137) NATE
{normala}Go back to the daughter.
138) RUSSELL
{normalb}There was a dad who had a daughter 'bout my age. One guy said he used to be a cop but nobody really believed him; then a teacher and his wife.
139) NATE
{thinkinga}What would you give her? Strong six?
140) RUSSELL
{sadb}I slipped outta there. I couldn't live like that.
141) 
Sure, whatever.
150) RUSSELL
{angrya}Sure, whatever.
142) NATE
{thinkinga}All right, maybe someone who wasn't so near and dear to your heart then.
143) NATE
{happyc}I gotta get my beak wet! I'll put it right in here.
144) NATE
{thinkinga}Just tell me something about her. {happya}How was the rack?
145) NATE
{happya}Gimme a little something. Just a taste.
146) NATE
{happyb}Russ, I'm doing you a service here.
147) 
Why do you gotta be like that?
148) 
You're fucking rude.
149) NATE
{thinkinga}Sure, whatever?! {sada}Come on!
151) RUSSELL
{thinkinga}Why you gotta be like that?
152) RUSSELL
{disgusta}Whatever.
153) NATE
{normala}Let's try this again.
154) NATE
{happya}WOMEN? {happyb}Ha, okay. Let me see if I can answer your question. Because... because the hunger a man's got for a WOMAN is all we got left now. No laws, no jobs, ain't nothin' that make us men. But they ain't eaten all the women yet.
155) NATE
{surprisea}Like what?
156) RUSSELL
{angrya}Always talking about women like that.
157) RUSSELL
{angrya}You're fucking rude, man.
158) NATE
{normalb}Let's try again.
159) NATE
{thinkingb}Asswipe's giving me fucking manners lessons?!
160) NATE
{normala}Oh, you're Miss Manners, that it?
161) RUSSELL
[guy slams on brakes] {feara}UGH!
162) NATE
{normala}What do you think?
163) RUSSELL
{fearb}What the fuck?!
164) NATE
{happya}She was slammin' before she was rotten, right? What do you think?
165) RUSSELL
[panicked] {feara}Guh...!
166) NATE
{happya}Here. Get a look.
167) RUSSELL
{fearb}FUCK!?!

{happya}IF YOU SAY FIVE I'M GONNA FLIP.
172) NATE
{crazya}MAYBE YOU GOT HIGH STANDARDS.
173) RUSSELL
{feara}NA--HELP!
