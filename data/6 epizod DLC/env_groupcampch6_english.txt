1) 
I found your note.
2) 
I followed the smoke.
3) 
It's what I do.
4) BECCA
[pickup2][considering not going with the stranger to a new settlement]{ThinkingA}{Body-A}Shel, why are we even listening to her? {DisgustB}She's obviously lying.
5) SHEL
[pickup2][considering not going with the stranger to a new settlement]{ThinkingA}Staying in one place makes you an easy target. {SadA}I don't care how safe you think it is.
6) SHEL
[pickup2][considering going with the stranger to a new settlement]{FearA}{Body-A}Look, I know it's a risk, but {FearB}what else is there?  {FearA}If you guys are going, then so are we.
7) SHEL
[pickup2][considering not going with the stranger to a new settlement]{FearA}{Body-A}Even if she's not, I think it's better to just keep on the move.
8) SHEL
[pickup2][Contemplating going with the stranger]{AngryA}{Body-A}Can you promise my sister will be safe?
9) SHEL
[pickup2][Contemplating going with the stranger]{SadA}...Okay, if it means that much to you.
10) BONNIE
[pickup2]{FearB}{Body-A}[startled gasp as Someone approaches the group]
11) TAVIA

12) TAVIA
[pickup2][carefully revealing herself to the group]{FearA}Hey, don't shoot....
13) VINCE
[pickup2][confronting the stranger/ Stern!]{SeriousB}Who the fuck are you?!
14) TAVIA
[pickup2][carefully revealing herself to the group]{ThinkingA}{Body-A}I'm a scout for a growing settlement up north. {NormalA}We go out and look for survivors to rescue them.
15) TAVIA
[pickup2][holding up the photos]{FearA}{Body-A}I found your note.
16) WYATT
[pickup2]{AngryA}{Body-A}How did you find us?
17) TAVIA
[pickup2]{ThinkingA}{Body-A}I followed the smoke.
18) TAVIA
[pickup2]{AngryA}{Body-A}It's what I do.
19) TAVIA
[pickup2]{HappyB}We have food, clean water and shelter for everyone. {HappyA}We're offering you a chance to help us out and start over.
20) VINCE
[pickup2]{SeriousA}{Body-A}Guys, look... if I learned one thing from Danny, it's that {SeriousB}we have to stick together and protect ourselves!
21) VINCE
[pickup2][considering the strangers offer -skeptical]{SeriousA}{Body-A}I heard rumors about these places. The guy I was... {SeriousC}"traveling" with ditched me trying to find one on his own. He thought....[he could con his way in and steal their resources][leaves the thought hanging]
22) WYATT
[pickup2][agreeing with Vince, this is a bad idea]{AngryA}{Body-A}Yeah, screw this. We don't know what kind of people we're dealing with. {NormalB}The only reason I'm with you guys is because Vince saved my life.
23) WYATT
[pickup2][excited by the idea that Eddie might be found]{FearB}{Body-A}Wait, you find survivors?! Do you find a lot?
24) WYATT
[pickup2][excited by the idea that Eddie might be found]{HappyA}{Body-A}Well, we gotta go. Eddie might be there.
25) TAVIA
[pickup2]{SadA}{Body-A}Not as many anymore, but....
26) VINCE
[pickup2][seeing the opportunity to take advantage of the strangers offer and ]{HappyC}You know what? Let's do this. She looks well fed, right? And clean? {HappyA}We could all use a meal and a hot shower!
27) BONNIE
[pickup2][hopeful]God, this sounds too good to be true. But... I think it is.
28) WYATT
[pickup2][disagreeing with Vince, this is a bad idea]{ThinkingA}{Body-A}Hold up. We don't know what kind of people we're dealing with.
29) RUSSELL
[pickup2]{AngryB}{Body-A}I don't want to talk about that, Wyatt.
30) WYATT
[pickup2]{AngryA}I don't want to get stuck with some crazy asshole like Russell did!
31) RUSSELL
[pickup2]{SadA}{Body-A}I walked away from that shit, Wyatt. {ThinkingA}And that dude was crazy from jump street.
32) BONNIE
[pickup2]Wyatt....[come on, Eddie is NOT there.]
33) WYATT
[pickup2]{NormalC}{Body-A}I'm just saying, she could be someone like that.
34) BECCA
[pickup2][to Shel]{ThinkingB}{Body-A}Maybe we should go too, Sis. {FearA}If Roman is still looking for us he wouldn't be able to do anything to us there.
35) TAVIA
[pickup2][getting down to business]{FearA}{Body-A}Look, I know you guys are wary and you have every right to be. {DisgustB}You don't know me from a hole in the ground and, yeah, {FearC}there are some crazy fuckers out there.[continues]
36) VINCE
[pickup2][definitive]{SeriousC}{Body-A}Yeah, {SeriousA}I'm going.
37) WYATT
[pickup2]{SadA}{Body-A}Yeah, I have to.
38) RUSSELL
[pickup2][uncertain]{SadA}{Body-A}I'm.. I'm just not sure. {FearA}We've been out here for SO long and seen so much bullshit. {SadA}Is it really worth getting our hopes up?
39) 
You might find people you know.
40) 
It's a safe place.
41) 
It's your choice.
42) TAVIA
[pickup2]{NormalA}{Body-A}It's your choice. {SadA}Again, I'm not trying to force you or convince you. {NormalA}As long as you're willing to obey the rules and pull your weight, you're welcome to come.
43) TAVIA
[pickup2][cont]{ThinkingA}But you've gotta decide now. We're not gonna be out this way again for a long time.
44) TAVIA
[pickup2]{FearA}{Body-A}Some of you may have been separated from friends or family... {FearB}it's a long shot, but there's a chance you could find them there.
45) TAVIA
[pickup2]{DisgustA}{Body-A}It's a safe place for everyone. {FearA}Criminal activity isn't tolerated wihin our walls. Period. {HappyB}You don't have to worry about bandits or walkers or anyone else. {HappyA}We look out for each other.
46) TAVIA
[pickup2]{HappyB}{Body-A}We have people of all ages in our colony. Teenagers. Whole families. It's a chance to reconnect with people {FearA}the way you used to.
47) 
There are people of all ages.
48) RUSSELL
[pickup2]{SadA}{Body-A}Have your people been through Statesboro?
49) TAVIA
[pickup2]{HappyB}Yes, I think we have.
50) RUSSELL
[pickup2] [thinking]{NormalA}...Okay. {AngryA}But I swear to God, if you try ANYTHING {AngryB}you're gonna regret it!
51) WYATT
[pickup2][half heartedly agreeing with Russell's threat]{NormalB}{Body-A}Yeah... {SadA}and if you're not lying, maybe... {NormalC}maybe Eddie will be there.
52) BONNIE
[pickup2]{HappyB}{Body-A}I believe her, Becca. Look at her. This is {HappyC}not someone who's been struggling the way we have. It makes sense.
53) BECCA
[pickup2][skeptical] {ThinkingB}{Body-A}...That's not true.[is it?]
54) BECCA
[pickup2] {SadA}Shel... this might sound stupid, but {SurpriseB}I think I actually wanna go.
55) TAVIA
[pickup2]{NormalA}{Body-A}She'll be as safe as she was before all this happened.
56) TAVIA
[pickup2][making sure Vince gets the message]{ThinkingB}{Body-A}Is that clear?
57) VINCE
[pickup2][realizes she's onto his plans already.  Guess I'll play it straight.]{SadA}{Body-A}Yeah. Clear.
58) TAVIA
[pickup2]{HappyC}{Body-A}Well, I guess we have our group.
59) RUSSELL
[pickup2]{NormalB}{Body-A}I don't know. I don't really believe in safe places. {SadA}Not anymore.
60) VINCE
[pickup2]{NormalA}{Body-A}We understand. {SadA}I think we've all made up our minds.
61) TAVIA
[pickup2]{SadA}I know it's hard, but this is your only chance. We're not gonna be out this way again for a long time.
62) TAVIA
[pickup2]{NormalA}I'm glad you feel that way. We're not gonna be out this way again for a long time.
63) TAVIA
[pickup2]{ThinkingA}{Body-A}We'll do everything we can to help you find your friends and family, {SadA}but understand that I can't promise anything.
64) TAVIA
[pickup2]{NormalA}What do you wanna do with these?
65) BONNIE
[pickup2]{ThinkingA}{Body-A}Of course you don't, Russell. {AngryA}You don't trust anyone!
66) BONNIE
[pickup2]{FearB}{Body-A}Well, why not, Russell? If they have food, and medicine and... and--
67) 
Then stay here if you want.
68) 
I'm not lying to you.
69) 
What will it take to convince you?
70) 
We could have killed you already.
71) 
You clearly outnumber me.
72) 
What are we gonna do, eat you?
73) TAVIA
[pickup2][quietly into the walkie talkie]{ThinkingA}{Body-A}I found 'em.
74) TAVIA
[pickup2][quietly into the walkie talkie]{HappyA}So far, so good. I'm gonna try to talk to 'em. Wish me luck.
75) RADIO
[pickup2][quiet, over the radio]Holy shit! Good job! Everything okay?
76) TAVIA
[pickup2][quietly into the walkie talkie]{NormalA}You got it.
77) RADIO
[pickup2]Yeah, good luck, and be careful. Don't try to force them into anything, just get as many of them as you can.
78) VINCE
[pickup2][process, in the distance 50 yards?][ambient]{NormalA}{Body-A}Tomorrow we'll circle back and try to figure out a new strategy for gathering supplies. {ThinkingA}We should probably split up into two parties. One to scout, make sure there are no lurkers.
79) RUSSELL
[pickup2]{AngryA}{Body-A}Yeah. "Medicine."
80) BONNIE
[pickup2][offended!] {AngryB}Look--
81) RUSSELL
[pickup2]{AngryB}I don't trust her, Bonnie!
82) TAVIA
[pickup2]{DisgustA}{Body-A}I'm not lying to you.
83) TAVIA
[pickup2]{DisgustB}{Body-A}What will it take to convince you?
84) TAVIA
[pickup2]{FearA}{Body-A}Then stay here if you want. I'm not bringing anyone against their will. {NormalA}We only want people who WANT to be there.
85) RUSSELL
[pickup2]{AngryB}{Body-A}No, fuck this, she's crazy! I don't trust her!
86) RUSSELL
[pickup2]{AngryA}{Body-A}I don't like this, guys. We should just walk away. {SadA}I don't trust her.
87) BECCA
[pickup2]{ThinkingB}{Body-A}How do we know that?
88) TAVIA
[pickup2]{NormalA}You don't. {FearA}You don't have to come, but we'd be happy to have you.
89) BONNIE
[pickup2]{SadB}{Body-A}Russell, come on....
90) RUSSELL
[pickup2]{SadA}{Body-A}I don't know.
91) VINCE
[pickup2][stern]{SeriousB}Don't fucking move!
92) RUSSELL
[pickup2]Vince![Theres someone here!!! Help]
93) TAVIA
[pickup2]{ThinkingA}{Body-A}Look, we need people, plain and simple. {NormalA}And you folks can decide if you want to come as a group, or split up, or whatever, {FearA}but I don't want to be out here in the open after dark.
94) TAVIA
[pickup2][cont]{NormalA}So in a few minutes, I'm gonna be getting back in my car and on my way. {ThinkingA}Hopefully at least some of you will follow me.
95) BONNIE
[pickup2]{NormalC}{Body-A}Well, I'm goin'.
96) WYATT
[pickup2]{ThinkingA}{Body-A}I don't understand what the problem is? {ThinkingB}Are you really considering staying out here? {AngryB}Foraging for food like fucking raccoons?!
97) VINCE
[pickup2]{SeriousC}{Body-A}Guys, trust me, {ThinkingA}we need to get to this place.[so we can loot it dry if we can!]
98) BONNIE
[pickup2][pleading]{ThinkingA}{Body-A}Come on, guys. {FearC}I mean, we left those photos so that someone could find us, didn't we?
99) WYATT
[pikcup2][cont]I mean, {SadA}then why'd we even leave the photos there?
100) BECCA
[pickup2]{ThinkingA}{Body-A}Well, it could be a trap! {FearA}What if they want to kill us?
101) RUSSELL
[pickup2]{HappyA}{Body-A}Thank you![for someone finally backing me up!] {NormalB}Everyone out there is bat shit crazy! We've all seen it!
102) BONNIE
[pickup2]{DisgustB}{Body-A}Well, we turned out all right, didn't we?
103) VINCE
[pickup2]{SadA}{Body-A}Relatively speaking.
104) TAVIA
[pickup2]{AngryA}{Body-A}If we wanted to kill you, you'd be dead already. {DisgustA}I had a gun, and snuck right up.
105) TAVIA
[pickup2]{AngryB}{Body-A}You clearly outnumber me. If you wanted to overpower me, you could. {AngryC}Hell, I'll even go along as your hostage until you feel safe. {DisgustA}No one is gonna hurt you.
106) TAVIA
[pickup2]{ThinkingB}{Body-A}What are we gonna do, eat you?
107) WYATT
[pickup2][suddenly worried]{FearE}{Body-A}...Are you gonna eat us?
108) TAVIA
[pickup2]{HappyB}No! That was a joke! I'm sorry.
109) RUSSELL
[pickup2]{AngryA}{Body-A}Well, what's stopping you?
110) TAVIA
[pickup2]{HappyA}Exactly! Nothing!
111) VINCE
[pickup2]{ThinkingA}{Body-A}That's not a bad idea, actually.
112) TAVIA
[pickup2]{HappyA}And I'll do it, because I know when you guys see this place {HappyC}you'll change your minds.
113) TAVIA
[pickup2]{NormalA}So... who wants to come with me?
114) TAVIA
[pickup2][cont]{ThinkingA}All I'm here to do is make an offer. You can come with me, or you can stay here. The choice is yours.
115) BECCA
[pickup2]{AngryB}{Body-A}Bonnie, get real! Just because she says it's true, doesn't mean it is.
116) BONNIE
[pickup2][stern, defensive]{AngryD}{Body-A}Hey! What I told Leland--[interrupted]
117) VINCE
[pickup2][stern]{AngryA}{Body-A}Cool it!
118) BONNIE
[pickup2][stern, defensive]{AngryD}{Body-A}At least what I did was an accident![you killed people on purpose!]
119) VINCE
[pickup2][stern]{AngryB}{Body-A}Hey! That's enough!
120) BECCA
[pickup2][cont]{AngryA}YOU should know about that.
121) BONNIE
[pickup2]{FearC}{Body-A}If I didn't trust people, I'd be dead. I know that for sure. {FearA}People can care about you if you let them.
122) BECCA
[pickup2]{AngryB}{Body-A}Bonnie, get real. Just because you have to tell the truth all the time, doesn't mean everyone else does!
123) VINCE
[pickup2][stern]{AngryA}{Body-A}That's enough, Becca!
124) BECCA
[pickup2]{AngryA}Like Leland cared when he let you run off alone?
125) RUSSELL
[pickup2][with disdain for Danny]{DisgustA}Don't worry about it.
126) RUSSELL
[pickup2]{ThinkingA}{Body-A}What?! That guy was an {AngryA}asshole! You should be happy he got killed before {NormalB}Shel & Becca joined us.
127) BECCA
[pickup2]{ThinkingB}{Body-A}Why?
128) RUSSELL
[pickup2]{AngryA}{Body-A}That truck stop was a death trap! It was right off the highway, for God's sake! {DisgustA}No way you and a bunch of sick old people were gonna defend it!
129) WYATT
[pickup2]{DisgustA}{Body-A}There's no way that guy is still looking for you. {NormalB}We've been to that truck stop... there's no one left.
130) RUSSELL
[pickup2]{NormalB}{Body-A}Roman's not a problem, {AngryA}it's following her that'll get ya killed.
131) BONNIE
[pickup2][reafirming]{HappyB}{Body-A}This is a good thing. {HappyA}I know it is.
132) VINCE
[pickup2]{SeriousC}How do we know this'll work out?
133) TAVIA
[pickup2]{SadA}{Body-A}You don't.
134) 
You don't.
135) 
I give you my word.
136) TAVIA
[pickup2]{ThinkingA}{Body-A}I give you my word.
137) 
What's the alternative?
138) TAVIA
[pickup2]{FearA}{Body-A}What's the alternative? Staying out here?
139) RUSSELL
[pickup2]{NormalB}{Body-A}But being smart... THAT'S what's keeping us alive!
140) BONNIE
[pickup2]{SadA}{Body-A}Of course it is, Russell. {ThinkingA}Hope is all we've got left!
141) TAVIA
[pickup2]{NormalA}{Body-A}Just remember, if you stay here, there's not gonna be anyone else coming to find you. {ThinkingA}Not for a long time.
142) WYATT
[pickup2]{ThinkingA}{Body-A}What's it gonna be, guys?
