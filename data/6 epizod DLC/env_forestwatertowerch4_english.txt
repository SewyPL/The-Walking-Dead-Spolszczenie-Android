{happyA}[wry disbelief] I swear, this is {happyC}the worst one ever.
66) LELAND
{happyB}[matter-of-fact] Free rein.
67) BONNIE
{thinkingB}[earnestly] Can I control this snake, or {happyC}{leland thinkingA}does it have free rein?
68) LELAND
{happyB}[serious] You know the rules, miss. You {thinkingA}gotta answer.
69) BONNIE
{normalA}[earnestly] Are the claws lobster size{happyC} or human-size?
70) 
This is ridiculous.
71) 
Can I control the snake?
72) 
Are the claws human size?
73) LELAND
{normalC}[matter-of-fact] Human-size. Can't {happyA}make this easy{happyB} on you.
74) LELAND
{happyA}It's a tough one, {happyB}I know.

86) BONNIE
{disgustA}You know, you're {fearB}not perfect either, {happyC}mister lobster hands. {sadA}Maybe I should spend a minute listin' off {happyA}YOUR flaws. See {happyC}how you like it?
87) BONNIE

88) 
Thanks. Jerk.
89) 
You're not perfect either.
90) 
Take a hike, big ears.
91) LELAND
{happyA}Hey, that's {happyB}what I'm here for.
92) BONNIE
{fearB}To remind me how {happyD}hideous I was?
93) LELAND
Nah, to {thinkingA}make sure you keep on keepin' on.
94) LELAND
{happyB}Look, as {thinkingA}long as you stay off that stuff, you can {happyA}have all the flaws you want.
95) LELAND
{happyB}I resemble that remark.
96) BONNIE
{normalC}Take a hike, {happyC}big ears.
97) BONNIE
You {happyA}resemble a satellite.
98) LELAND
{thinkingA}Ya know, you weren't so damn sassy {happyB}before. Guess that's a good sign.
99) LELAND
{fearA}[awd] Sorry; I guess {sadA}things are still{sadB} a little raw for you.
100) LELAND
{normalA}[getting serious for a moment] Look. You {sadA}know I ain't goin' nowhere, right?
101) LELAND
{thinkingA}--or lobster claws {happyA}for hands?
102) BONNIE
{happyA}[wry] Awful.
103) BONNIE
{happyC}Aw, come on. You'd {happyA}be a lot less fun.
104) LELAND
{sadA}[changing subject] You've been a lot {thinkingA}MORE fun lately. {happyA}Feelin' better?
105) BONNIE
{thinkingA}I guess {happyB}I am.
106) LELAND
{surprisedA}[Caught off guard] Dee!
230) LELAND

109) DEE
{disgustA}[Like talking to a child]Chattin' huh? {angryA}What about?
110) DEE
{thinkingA}[struggling to keep it light and hide suspicion] "Confidential." {angryA}I see. What was the {disgustA}topic of this confidential board meetin'?
111) BONNIE
{sadB}[trying again] {disgustA}Confidential?
112) DEE
{fearB}[indignant] "Private"?
113) LELAND

{sadA}[Starting up] We were... {fearA}worried about you, hon.
131) DEE
{disgustA}[matter-of-fact] Well, I'm {angryA}just dandy.

133) LELAND

135) LELAND
{sadA}[covering] Won't let up today.
136) DEE

137) BONNIE
{fearC}[searching]Oh... um... {disgustA}the {fearA}rain.

That's right. And {happyD}you're older than dirt.
139) DEE
{disgustA}[pointed]And what were you talkin' about?
143) LELAND
{thinkingA}So... where'd you {fearA}get the bag, Dee?
144) DEE
{thinkingA}[To Leland] You guys sure gang up on me {angryA}a lot lately.
145) LELAND
{sadA}Honey, that {disgustA}ain't true.
146)

Quit being so cagey.
148) 
Did you steal it?
149) BONNIE
{thinkingA}Was anyone {fearA}there?
150) DEE

152) DEE
{angryD}[defensive, shocked] What?!
153) BONNIE
{angryA}[accusatory] Did ya steal {sadA}it?
154) LELAND
{sadB}Dee, Bonnie's right; if {thinkingA}you stole that bag, {fearA}we need to know. {disgustA}Don't gotta make no big deal out of it.
155) LELAND
{sadA}[serious] Dee, {angryA}honey, {disgustA}where'd you get the bag?
156) DEE
{fearB}[flustered, defensive] I don't {disgustA}understand. What's the {angryC}big deal?
157) LELAND
[pickup1]{angryC}[serious] It IS a big deal, {angryB}honey.
158) LELAND
{fearA}[serious] Long as we're together, {thinkingA}I'll be there for you. {happyA}You ain't gotta worry. You {sadA}know that, right?
159) BONNIE
{fearB}[whisper-shout] What the {angryB}hell was THAT?!

{angryB}[whisper-shout] Does she {fearB}think we ...?
161) BONNIE

167) BONNIE
{thinkingA}[pointed] What's in the {sadA}bag, Dee?
168) LELAND
{thinkingA}[carefully wading in] Not to interrupt the girl talk here, {fearA}but, Dee... {angryA}that bag--
169) LELAND
{angryA}[pointed] I ain't the one who {disgustA}stopped, Dee.
170) DEE
{angryB}[fighting with husband] But you ARE the one who {angryD}made ME stop.
171) LELAND
{angryB}[indignant, fighting with wife] Attitude?!
172) DEE
{angryA}[frustrated, emotionally hurt] Now we're standin' here in the woods, {fearB}soakin' through, and {thinkingA}for what? Don't you {angryA}want to get to the camp before dark?
173) DEE
{angryA}[pointed] I've about had it {angryC}with that attitude.
174) LELAND
{thinkingA}[frustrated] Irregardless, we could {disgustA}just as easy carry on like this {angryA}while we're walkin'.
175) DEE
{fearB}False. This is how {angryA}all our fights go. {disgustA}Every time.
176) LELAND
{thinkingA}[flustered] All right, I {disgustA}can't remember one ESPECIALLY, but {fearA}I know I have.
177) LELAND
{thinkingA}That's not really an answer.
178) LELAND
Well, you sure do LOOK better. {thinkingA}Though you gotta admit, anything {happyB}is an improvement.
179) BONNIE
[amused] {happyC}You don't set the rules 'round here.
180) LELAND
[admitting, jovial] Well, {happyA}that's a fact.
181) LELAND
{thinkingA}Well?

186) BONNIE
{happyA}Both.
184) BONNIE
{sadA}But they're both such {happyC}attractive options.
185) LELAND
{surprisedA}Both?! The {normalC}whole pointa' the game {happyA}is to choose!
187) 
I'm a real poster child.
188) 
You're a good friend.
189) 
Oh, shut up.
190) LELAND
{sadA}I mean it, though. {fearA}After we found ya, {fearB}you were still so hooked on that stuff... {thinkingA}I never thought you'd make it.
191) BONNIE
{sadA}[sarc] Yeah, I'm a {happyD}real poster child.
192) BONNIE
{sadA}[honest] You're a {happyC}good friend, Leland.
193) BONNIE
{fearB}[wry] Oh, shut up. What {happyA}are you, my sponsor?
194) LELAND
{thinkingA}[wry] I could see you on a brochure.
195) BONNIE
{fearB}Like the ones at the dentist? Before and {happyA}after? With the puffy {happyC}face and the yella teeth?
196) BONNIE
{happyA}[wry] Okay, you're not {happyD}THAT great.
197) LELAND
{happyB}[matter-of-fact] I know.
210) 
I know.
198) LELAND
{happyA}[wry] I'm the {happyB}best you got.
199) BONNIE
{happyD}[sarc] God help me.
200) LELAND
"Just {happyB}look at her now."
201) LELAND
You {happyB}got me there.
202) DEE
{sadA}I'd kill for a towel right now.
203) BONNIE
{happyA}Or a blow dryer.
204) LELAND
[pickup1]{fearA}All I'm sayin' is, {happyA}good luck findin' a man if {thinkingA}you have lobster hands.
205) BONNIE
{happyC}[defensive, amused] Think of all the crazy {happyA}stuff you could grab!
206) BONNIE
{happyA}[defensive, amused] What? How is that MORE {happyD}gross than LOBSTER HANDS?
207) LELAND
Well, for {surprisedA}one, it's {thinkingA}in your mouth.
208) DEE
{happyA}[amused] Yes! Good Lord, deliver us a blow dryer.
209) DEE
{angryB}Well, TOO bad, you {angryD}already are.

218) DEE
{thinkingA}[evasive]I told you, {disgustA}it's a surprise....
219) LELAND
{angryA}[raising voice] Dee, did ya hear me?
220) DEE
{angryA}[annoyed] Keep up the pace, you two.
221) BONNIE
{happyA}[jovial] Hey, Dee, when we get back to camp, would {disgustA}you let me borrow some of that {happyC}nail polish?
222) DEE
{happyB}[jovial] Sure, hon. You {happyA}like this color?
223) BONNIE
{normalA}It's my favorite. And after {sadA}today I could use a {happyC}new coat, ya know?
224) DEE
{disgustA}Same here. I feel like a {fearA}drowned rat with these claws.
225) LELAND
{thinkingA}[frustrated] Dammit, Dee, you gotta {angryB}give us more than that.
226) BONNIE
{sadA}[amused] And how exactly do ya {happyC}"think harder?"
227) LELAND
{happyB}[joking] Think harder.
228) LELAND
{thinkingA}Good point. I'll {happyA}think about that.
229) BONNIE
{happyA}Hey, you asked the question, hoss.
231) LELAND

238) BONNIE
Good thing I'm {happyD}not lookin' for one, then.
239) LELAND
{sadB}[Stumbling] I mean, {disgustA}you were. {thinkingA}You were, uh... {sadA}you know.
240) LELAND
{fearB}[Apologetic] That came out wrong... {sadA}what I mean is....
241) LELAND
{disgustA}[getting frustrated] WHERE down the road?
242) DEE
{angryA}[dismissive] Some place off {angryC}thatta way.
243) DEE
{angryA}[snapping] Look, I found it down the road a {angryC}piece, all right?
244) DEE

245) LELAND
{angryA}[frustrated] Just tell us, baby.
246) LELAND
{fearA}[trying not to get angry] You don't think, {disgustA}or you don't know?
247) DEE
{disgustA}[evasive] I don't think so.
248) LELAND
{thinkingA}[changing subject] Calm down, Dee. Just {sadB}tell us where ya {disgustA}found the bag.
249) DEE
{fearA}[defensive]Me, cagey? You two {angryA}are the ones bein' cagey.
250) LELAND
