16) LEE
{body-B}{ThinkingB}This is too much stuff for just one person.
17) LEE
{body-B}{ThinkingA}We don't know whose camp this is. {SadA}Might not be bandits.
18) DANNY
[disappointed] {body-A}{AngryB}God dammit.
19) DANNY

20) DANNY
{body-A}{SurprisedA}Shit!
21) LEE
{body-B}{SurpriseB}She was about to shoot us both!
22) DANNY
{body-A}{AngryA}You could've just taken her down. {ThinkingA}You didn't have to kill her.
23) LEE
{body-B}{AngryA}Justice. {ThinkingA}They've killed too many people.
24) DANNY
{body-A}{SurprisedA}Jeez. {HappyA}Whatever, Tex.
25) LEE
{body-B}{AngryC}You heard her. {SurpriseB}She was too far gone.
26) DANNY
{body-A}{AngryA}She was a fuckin' freakshow, {SurprisedA}but you didn't have to kill her.
27) DANNY
{body-A}{SadB}I mean, I know she was crazy {AngryB}but... damn!
28) DANNY
{body-A}{AngryA}Lee, don't piss her off.
29) JOLENE
{CrazyC}Killin' everywhere. {CrazyD}Take all the dead folks you want, we'll make more!
30) JOLENE
{body-Crossbow}{HappyD}Like you could kill me. {CrazyA}They couldn't kill me. {CrazyD}They tried.
31) LEE
{body-B}{AngryB}Screw this.
32) LEE
{body-B}{SadB}Put down the crossbow.
33) JOLENE
{body-Crossbow}{AngryB}No, sir, I need it.

[angrily] {body-B}{AngryD}Enough!

{ThinkingA}How on {HappyB}earth did y'all {HappyC}get barbecue meat?
38) DUCK
[excited] {HappyB}Barbecue! Oh, boy!
39) LEE
{AngryB}Let her go, Brenda!
40) KATJAA
[scared]Please, listen to him!
41) LEE
{FearA}Think about what you're doing. {SadC}It doesn't have to end like this.
42) ANDY
[ambient conversation]What do you do for a living, Kenny?
43) KENNY
[ambient conversation]I.. uh... I was a fisherman down in Fort Lauderdale.
44) DANNY
[ambient conversation]If we were lucky we'd bring in a Sturgeon  or two, but man... Never been out in the deep sea.
45) DANNY
[ambient conversation]Man, that sounds nice! Daddy used to take us out for large mouth bass when we were kids.
46) KENNY
[ambient conversation]Commercially, Snapper and Yellow fin mostly. But in the summers I'd take tourists out for some sailfish!
47) KENNY
[ambient conversation]I tell ya, there ain't nothing like fresh tuna straight from the sea - to the grill - to the plate!!  Especially the way Kat cooks it up!
48) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]I met Ken after I opened my Veterinary office  and he came in with a sick octopus!
49) KENNY
[ambient conversation]What?  Where else was i gonna take it?
50) DANNY
[ambient conversation]Where are you from Katjaa?  That accent sure ain't from Georgia!
51) KATJAA
[ambient conversation][friendly]No, definitely not!  My family is from Belgium, but we moved to Florida when I was in my teens.
52) KENNY
[ambient conversation]Dan, did you always work here at the dairy?
53) DANNY
[ambient conversation]Me?  no, that was Daddy's business.  I ran an insurance company over in Decatur.
54) KENNY
[ambient conversation]I hear that.
55) DANNY
[ambient conversation]Yeah, anyway, it was good business.  But when all this shit went down, I had to come home.  Family is more important, ya know?
56) ANDY
[ambient conversation]Yeah, well Dan felt it would be best to get away from Macon for a while. Had some... trouble.
57) LILLY
[ambient conversation]Decatur?
58) ANDY
[ambient conversation]Well, I took over as business manager eventually. Put that college degree to work.
59) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]What did you do before that?
60) ANDY
[ambient conversation]	I had a real estate business, but, you know... in this economy...
61) DANNY
[ambient conversation]Yeah, Daddy always wanted you to take over anyway.
62) ANDY
[ambient conversation]Just worked out that way, Dan.
63) LARRY
[ambient conversation]How long have ya had this Dairy?
64) ANDY
[ambient conversation]Long as I can remember.  We grew up here.  Dan and I helped out where we could, but really this was a Mom and Pop business.
65) LILLY
[ambient conversation]So you two didn't work here?
66) ANDY
[ambient conversation]	So how long have you been a vet?
67) DANNY
[ambient conversation]You work with many farm animals?
68) KATJAA
[ambient conversation][trying to think back] Ooh... well... a long time now.
69) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]Early in my training I did, but them mostly it was household pets.
70) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]I started working in a veterinarian  office in my twenties, then got my license a few years later.
71) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]Oh yes. Wildlife Rescue center was always bringing their injured alligators to me to get patched up before releasing them.
72) DUCK
[ambient conversation]And alligators!
73) CLEMENTINE
[ambient conversation]Nu uh!
74) LILLY
[ambient conversation]So that fence does a good job of keeping the walkers out, huh?
75) DUCK
[ambient conversation]Once, my dad smashed one in the face with a TV!
76) DUCK
[ambient conversation]Sorry.
77) ANDY
[ambient conversation]Yeah. Unfortunately we lost most of our livestock before we managed to get the thing rigged up.
78) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]Kenny Jr!  That is not appropriate talk at the dinner table.
79) DANNY
[ambient conversation][mumbled]Damned walkers.
80) KENNY
[ambient conversation]Our hunting trips have turned up nothing. The walkers are eating anything living they can get their teeth into.
81) DANNY
[ambient conversation]	Well, ya just have to know what to hunt.  There's meat out there that'll keep you alive if ya know what to look for.
82) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]Thanks again for this meal.  You have no idea how longs it's been!
83) KENNY
[ambient conversation]how have you folks managed to find food?
84) ANDY
[ambient conversation]And what do you do Miss Lilly?
85) LARRY
[ambient conversation]	Lilly's a military woman.  Takes after her old man.
86) DANNY
[ambient conversation]That right?  Ever see any action?
87) LILLY
[ambient conversation][blunt, emotionless]I have.
88) LARRY
[ambient conversation]	Son, you don't ever ask a soldier that question, got it?
89) LARRY
[ambient conversation]All you need to know is that you don't wanna fuck with her. Period.
90) LILLY
[ambient conversation]Dad...
114) LILLY
[panicked] DAD?!
91) DANNY
[ambient conversation]Yeah, I'm sorry.
92) ANDY
[ambient conversation]	Don't pay my brother no mind.  I swear he makes a hobby of chewing his own foot.
93) ANDY
[ambient conversation]So did ya'all know each other before the outbreak?
94) LILLY
[ambient conversation]No. We just sort of found ourselves thrown together.
95) LILLY
[ambient conversation]But now we've gotta stick together if we're gonna survive.
96) ANDY
[ambient conversation]	I hear ya.  Ya gotta know when to make sacrifices for the greater good, ya know.
97) KENNY
[ambient conversation]It ain't right though.  No kid should have to see the things they've seen.
98) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]Kids are resilient, you know?  I hate that this is the way they have to grow up, but under the circumstances, I think they are doing well.
99) DANNY
[ambient conversation]How have the kids been dealing with ...everything?
100) DANNY
[ambient conversation]Maybe I should check on him?
101) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]Let the man clean up. He'll be done in a minute.
102) DUCK
[ambient conversation]Are we gonna eat soon, momma?
103) LARRY
[ambient conversation]How long does it takes to wash your damn hands?
104) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]As soon as Lee gets back.
105) ANDY
[ambient conversation]Yeah, Maybelle is the only one we have left.
106) DANNY
[ambient conversation][cont.] She provides the milk.
107) CLEMENTINE
[ambient conversation]I like your cow.  She's pretty.
108) DANNY
[ambient conversation]That's why we need Katjaa's help.
109) DANNY
[ambient conversation]We'd love to have another healthy calf, but we mostly want to make sure maybelle is okay.
110) LEE
[pickup1][hushed but shocked!] Mark?!  What the hell happened?!!
111) MARK
[pickup1][weakly..drugged, trying to tell Lee what happened] ... brothers...
112) LILLY
Dad! Please, stop!
113) LARRY
[Having a heart attack!] Hrrrgggttt!!!   Oh God...
115) LILLY
[worried] No! Dad, come on! DAD!
116) LILLY
Oh God, he's stopped breathing. I think he's had a heart attack!
117) KENNY
Shit!  Is he dead?
118) LILLY
[anguished] Medicine? You had medicine?! You BASTARD!
119) LEE
I...
120) LILLY
[pickup2] [pissed] Don't talk to me, Lee. Don't fucking talk to me.
121) LEE
[pickup2] Lilly, I-
122) LILLY
He's not dead.  Somebody help me!
123) KENNY
[realizing that Larry may turn zombie]Fuuuuuuck... if he's dead...
124) LILLY
HE'S NOT DEAD!
125) LEE
We can't kill him if he's not dead, Kenny!
126) KENNY
[successfully pulling the AC off the wall]
166) DUCK
[scared whimpering as he's held at gunpoint]
127) KENNY
[A little brethless/ slightly hushed]Well there's our way out, Lee.
128) CLEMENTINE
{sadA}I had it a couple days ago.
129) LEE
{normalC}When did you lose it?
130) LEE
{normalD}Do you really need it?
131) LEE
{sadA}Sorry, hon, I don't have time.
134) CLEMENTINE
{sadA}I'm really hungry, Lee.
135) LEE
{normalD}How are you doing, Clementine?
136) LILLY
{normalB}If the hunting trips nearby don't work, we'll just have to head farther out.
137) LILLY
{angryB}But this is a good spot.  {normalB}We're protected, we're close to the drug store, {thinkingA}we have a routine now and it's working.
138) LILLY
{angryA}God, not you too.  I know kenny wants to leave.  I think that's why he's so eager to get the RV working.
139) LEE
{normalC}These generators are enough to power the whole dairy?
140) LEE
{normalD}Is it just the three of you here?
141) ANDY
{normalA}'Fraid so. {sadA}We lost Daddy the first month.
142) ANDY
{angryA}Then we had some run-ins with the fuckin' bandits about a month and a half ago, {sadA}killed one of the hands.
143) ANDY
{angryA}Then HE came back and took out the rest of the hands before we could stop him.
144) LEE
{thinkingB}An electric fence is enough to keep out walkers?
145) ANDY
{happyC}Walkers? {happyB}Is that what you call them? That's good. [beat] {normalC}The old one wouldn't have, but Mac -- he was our foreman -- {happyA}he figured out how to amp it up with the generators.
146) ANDY
{happyB}We used to sit out here some nights and watch the sons o' bitches sizzle and pop when they got too close.
147) ANDY
{happyA}Closest thing to entertainment these days, I guess.
148) LEE
{normalD}Can we help out with the fence?
149) ANDY
{normalB}Actually, yeah. {normalA}A couple of walkers managed to get in while the generators were out of gas.
150) DANNY
{normalC}Remember: we're just doing reconnaissance for now. No use getting ourselves killed.
151) DANNY
{normalC}What do you think of the place?
152) LEE
{normalA}It's beautiful.
165) MARK
{happyA}It's beautiful.
153) LEE
{normalC}How?
154) DANNY
{normalC}It's cool.  {normalB}You don't have to decide right now.  {normalA}But don't wait too long or you may not have a choice.
155) BRENDA
Sittin' out here, looking over the farm, I can pretend that things are like they used to be.
156) BRENDA
[pickup2]That's the world we're living in now, I guess.
157) LEE
I'd still like to check on him.
158) BRENDA
[pickup2]You're gonna have to trust me on this one, Lee.  I've helped stitch my share of wounds...I know what I'm talking about.
159) BRENDA
Just you wait, Lee, things are gonna seem so much nicer once you've all had supper and a good night's rest.
160) BRENDA
[pickup2][friendly]Please! After what we've been through...you can call me Brenda!
161) LEE
[pickup2][initiating conversation]Mrs. St. John...
162) LEE
[pickup2][initiating conversation] Pardon me, Brenda...
163) BRENDA
[pickup2][friendly]What's on your mind, Lee?
164) ANDY
{happyB}Here it is.  St. John's family dairy.  {normalC}It ain't much, {happyA}but it's kept us safe so far.
167) LEE
[Calling out, firm] {AngryC} Andy!
168) BEN
[quiet]{AngryA}I knew it! [to Doug/Carley]{FearA}I told you we couldn't trust them
169) LEE
[quiet]{NormalC}Do you have a weapon?
170) BEN
{disgustA}It's not the bite that does it! {fearA}Yeah, the bite will kill you, but...
171) KENNY
[furious] {angryC}You said he wasn't bitten!
172) BEN
{disgustA}You come back no matter how you die.  {sadB}If you don't destroy the brain, {disgustA}that's just what happens.  {sadC}That's what's gonna to happen to ALL of us.
173) LEE
[a bit out of breath]{normalD} Thanks.
174) LEE
[Shouting] The Axe!  Hurry!!
175) DUCK
{happyA}Okay.  Me and Clementine are coloring.
176) DUCK
{thinkingA}Yeah.  When are we gonna get some food?
177) LEE
{happyA}The wall's looking good, Doug.
178) DOUG
{happyA}Thanks. {normalA}I also worked up a little "early warning system" for outside.
179) LEE
{thinkingA}Early warning system?
180) DOUG
{thinkingA}Well... it's just string with some cans attached, buy hey, it works.
181) LEE
[flat]{normalD}Hey, Doug.
182) CLEMENTINE
[to ben; quizzing him about her drawing] {normalC}Guess what it is?
183) BEN
[still a little out of sorts; guessing what clems picture is of]{sadA} I don't know... a dog?
184) CLEMENTINE
{happyB}Nope.
185) DUCK
{happyB}Oh, I know!  It's a goat, right?
186) LEE
{normalD}Thanks for keeping the kids over here.
187) CARLEY
{happyB}Yeah, well, my instinct was to run over and get the story.  But ... {sadA}yeah... the kids didn't need to see that.
188) CARLEY
{thinkingA}Oh, and do me a favor and talk to Lilly about getting some rest.  {angryA}You and I are supposed to be on watch together tonight.  I need you sharp.
189) DOUG
{sadA}Hey, I owe you a lot more than a half eaten candy bar.  Take it.
190) LEE
{sadA}Thanks. {thinkingA}I appreciate it.
191) LEE
{sadB}Keep it.
192) DOUG
{fearA}You look like crap, Lee. When was the last time you ate?
193) CARLEY
{thinkingA}You look like crap, Lee. When was the last time you ate?
194) LEE
[Don't worry about me]{sadA}I'm okay.
195) CARLEY
{disgustA}I want you to have this, okay? In case you or Clementine starts feeling weak.
196) LEE
{sadA}You don't owe me anything, Carley.
197) LEE
[friendly, talking to Duck]{normalD}Have I missed anything?
198) DUCK
No, not really.
199) KATJAA
[pickup1]Kids! [dont be rude!...and stop giggling over the word Doo-Dee!]
200) CLEMENTINE
[pickup1][giggles at the word "doo-dee"]
202) DUCK
[pickup1][giggles at the word "doo-dee"]
201) CLEMENTINE
[pickup1][whispered] Doo-dee!
203) DUCK
[pickup1][confused]What's "manure"?
204) CLEMENTINE
[pickup1][When duck says Lee smells funny, Clem remebers what Lee said at Hershel's Barn][proud that she learned a new word]...Like manure!
205) CLEMENTINE
[pickup1][sad and embarased after being scolded about using swear words]Okay.
206) CLEMENTINE
[pickup1][When duck says Lee smells funny, Clem remebers what Lee said at Hershel's Barn]Like... Shit, right Lee?
207) LEE
[pickup1][after Clem says something smells like "shit"] Hey, don't use swear words, okay?
208) CLEMENTINE
[pickup1][When duck says Lee smells funny, Clem remebers what Lee said at Hershel's Barn]...Like doo-dee!
