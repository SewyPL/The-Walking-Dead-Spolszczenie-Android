It gets lots of tangles.

Did your daddy give you that hat?
4) CLEMENTINE
Mmhmm.
5) CLEMENTINE
I have a goldfish named Peanut. Mom doesn't like dogs.
6) KATJAA
Do you have any pets?
7) KATJAA
Oh, well we have a lab named Franklin back in Fort Lauderdale.
8) KATJAA
What's your favorite color?

They're my favorite.
11) KATJAA
Ooh, I like your shoes!
12) LEE
Hey there, girls.
13) LEE
[warm] Hey.
14) 
You two actually looked relaxed.
21) LEE
{normalC} You two actually looked relaxed.
15) LEE
{thinkingB} Well, yeah.[like "duh"]
16) KATJAA
{normalA} Anyway, it's almost like {thinkingA}we didn't see people eating each other for the past three days. {happyA}It's peaceful here, no?
17) CLEMENTINE
{happyB} It's easy.
18) LEE
{thinkingA} Oh, uh, {happyB} how is that?
19) LEE
{fearA} Sooo you're {happyB}good?
20) KATJAA
{happyB} I think we're doing just fine. {happyC} Clementine was just telling me about first grade.
22) 
How was the city?
23) LEE
{normalD} How did you handle getting through the city?
24) KATJAA
{fearA} Used to?! {disgustA} Lee, there's a horrible thing going on {happyC}but the world certainly isn't over.
25) KATJAA
{thinkingB} Kenny just...drove. {sadA} We passed so many people that needed help. {sadB} And... we just... passed people, over some. Just...just...
26) LEE
{happyA} Good.
27) LEE
{sadB} It's ok. It's fine, you don't have to say anymore.
28) KATJAA
{happyA} What is that you do, Lee?
29) KATJAA
{fearA} I'm just in shock. {happyC} Talking to your girl here is a welcome bit of normal.
30) LEE
{normalB} I used to teach up at the University of Georgia.
31) LEE
{thinkingA} No, I used to. {normalC} I was let go a little while back.
56) LEE
{thinkingA} No, I used to. {normalC} I was let go a little while back
32) LEE
[Lie] {normalD} Yeah, my mistake.
59) LEE
[Lie] {normalD} Yeah, my mistake.
33) 
No, I USED to.
54) 
No, I USED to.
34) 
My mistake.
57) 
My mistake.
35) KATJAA
{sadB} That's too bad. {normalB} Well, I hear people always clamor back to college after a big disaster. {happyB} People don't want to die ignorant, I guess.
55) KATJAA
{sadB} That's too bad. {normalB} Well, I hear people always clamor back to college after a big disaster. {happyB} People don't want to die ignorant, I guess.
36) KATJAA
{happyB} You'll be back in the classroom in no time.
58) KATJAA
{happyB} You'll be back in the classroom in no time.
37) KATJAA
{normalA} Well, I just think it's important to stay optimistic around [gesturing towards his daughter at your side] {happyC}our kids.
38) KATJAA
{happyC} Perhaps you should check on Hershel in the barn, he's {disgustA}been awfully quiet.
39) 
Back in a bit.
40) LEE
{happyA} Back in a bit.
41) KATJAA
[goodbye] {happyC} Ok, Lee.
42) LEE
Seems like those two are getting along.
43) LEE
[sizing her up, to himself] Katjaa's good with her.
44) CLEMENTINE
{happyA} Yeah.
45) LEE
You having a nice time with Katjaa, Clementine?
46) LEE
[having said a dumb thing] Yeah, ok.
47) LEE
Um, do you have to go to the bathroom, or anything like that?
48) KATJAA
{thinkingA} Lee, the young woman can take care of herself!
49) 
What do you do?
50) KATJAA
{happyC} More than you would think, actually.
51) LEE
{happyA} Maybe the odd alligator?
52) KATJAA
{happyB} I am veterinarian back in Fort Lauderdale -- {fearA} like Hershel, here, {disgustA}except more with dogs and cats and not horses.
53) LEE
{thinkingA} So uhh, what do you do{happyA} when... corpses aren't walking around?
60) KATJAA
{normalA} Well, I just think it's important to say optimistic around [gesturing towards his daughter at your side] {happyC} our little ones.
61) KATJAA
[pickup1] I want to go home tomorrow, but even then I can't take away the things we -- the things Duck -- went through.
62) KATJAA
[pickup1] Don't you want to go back to the moment before you knew about all of this?
63) 
Who wouldn't?
64) 
Things happen for a reason.
65) 
Was bad before.
66) KATJAA
[pickup1]All of those things.
67) LEE
{happyA} Those are the things we live for, right? {fearA} With those gone, what's the point?
68) LEE
{normalD} Anybody in their right mind would. Families and BBQ's and beers with good friends.
69) KATJAA
[pickup1]Not what we saw.
70) LEE
{normalD} This could all be providence, you know.
71) LEE
{thinkingA} You just never realize when something is happening to you what you're being given; {happyA} maybe this will all work out.
72) KATJAA
[pickup1]Your optimism is...refreshing. New. These past couple days, at least.
73) LEE
{thinkingB} But they weren't before? {angryA} The banks, the politics, the-the crap -- those things are gone. {normalB} Hell comes in a lot of different colors.
74) LEE
{disgustB} Things were bad before, bad now, but they're different, you see?
75) KATJAA
[pickup1]People are eating each other.
76) KATJAA
[pickup1]My last thought I had before seeing any of what happened was of those wrinkly Shar pei's I see at the clinic. I want to go right back to thinking about that silly dog.
82) KATJAA
[pickup1]My last thought I had before seeing any of what happened was of those wrinkly Shar pei's I see at the clinic. I want to go right back to thinking about that silly dog.
77) KATJAA
[pickup1]We need to HOPE that we go back to our jobs soon, Lee. Back to normal. It can't stay like this.
78) KATJAA
[pickup1] We'll all be home soon.
79) KATJAA
[pickup1] We'll all be home soon.
