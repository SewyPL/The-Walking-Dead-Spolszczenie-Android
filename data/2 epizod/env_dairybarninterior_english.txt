{body-A}{HappyA}Yeah, I'll check with Momma.
69) LEE

70) KATJAA
{body-Sit}{ThinkingA}That should buy you a few minutes...
71) DUCK
{body-A}{ThinkingA}Daddy says it's called a salt lick.
72) CLEMENTINE
{body-Stand}{ThinkingA}Yeah, but don't lick it.  {DisgustA}It's gross.
73) LEE
{body-B}{ThinkingA}What's this thing?
74) CLEMENTINE
[bashful] {HappyB}I don't know...
75) LEE
{HappyA}Did you lick it?
76) LEE
[hushed] {body-B}{DisgustA}This room looks like a slaughter house...
77) LEE
[hushed] {ThinkingA}Yeah, that was my thought, too.
78) KATJAA
[hushed]{body-Sit}{ThinkingB}In a dairy?
79) KATJAA
{body-Sit}{HappyA}What do you see? {ThinkingA}Any food?
80) ANDY
[stern] {body-A}{ThinkingA}Lookin' for something, Lee?

[Ya know what, despite it all-]{body-Sit}{HappyA}They're doing okay.[Recorded during 101 pickups]
92) LEE
{body-B}{ThinkingA}What do you think of the Dairy?
93) KATJAA
{body-Sit}{HappyA}It's nice... {ThinkingA}But I don't think we should get to comfortable.  {NormalC}We don't really know these people yet, {ThinkingA}ya know?
94) KATJAA
{body-Sit}{HappyA}The St. John's have been very friendly to them. {ThinkingA}But...[Recorded during 101 pickups]
95) KATJAA
If something happens and you've gotta choose between the kids or them, {AngryA}don't repeat what happened with the walkers at Hershel's farm.[Recorded during 101 pickups]
96) KATJAA
[cont.]{ThinkingA}You choose the kids this time.[Recorded during 101 pickups]
97) KATJAA
[pickup1][Asking Lee to check out the back room, but thinking he might chicken out][Follows: 310411407] {body-Sit}{AngryA}I'm not asking you to help out with surgery or anything...
98) LEE
[pickup1][awkward, having been called out for not helping Katjaa with surgery earlier in the day]{body-B}{SadA}Listen, I -
99) KATJAA
[pickup1][Assuring Lee an apology isn't neccessary, just do this thing instead]{NormalC}You don't need to say anything.  {SadA}Just please, {ThinkingA}get rid of Andrew for a minute so we can get a look back there.
100) LEE
[pickup1][responding to katjaa asking for help distracting Danny in the barn]{body-B}{ThinkingA}I'll do whatever I can. [Remembering how his help didnt save David]{SadA}Maybe this time I can actually help.
101) KATJAA
[pickup1][Lee offers help with the Barn, but regrets that his help earlier didnt save david]{body-Sit}{SadA}Lee... {SadB}you did your best with David.  So did I.  {ThinkingA}But if you want to help the rest of us, {NormalC}you need to distract Andrew and see what's in that back room.

[pickup2] {Body-D}{ThinkingA}You found it too, eh?
116) LEE
[pickup2][trying to calm Kenny down]{Body-B}{ThinkingA}Don't get paranoid.

[pickup2][whisper]  {Body-HandsHips}{AngryA}Lee, they're hiding something.  Behind this door.
118) KENNY
[pickup2]{Body-D}{AngryA}It's my JOB to be paranoid, Lee.  {AngryB}I got my whole family on this farm right now.  {ThinkingA}How about you?  What about Clem?

[pickup2]{Body-B}{AngryA}You're being stupid, Kenny.
122) KENNY
[pickup2]{Body-D}I know you will.
123) KENNY
[pickup2]{Body-D}{SadA}Pfft.  May as well be now, man.  {ThinkingA}That girl needs you.
124) KENNY
[pickup2][hurt] {Body-D}{AngryA}Stupid?  {AngryB}Stupid?!  {DisgustA}Nice one, Lee.
125) KENNY
[pickup2]{Body-D}{SadB}You gotta think about that little girl now, Lee.
126) KENNY
[pickup2]{ThinkingA}So go find a hammer, and I'll have this thing off in a second.  {AngryA}You back me up in case them farmers come running.
127) LEE
[pickup2]{ThinkingB}Hang on, man.  Think this through.  {AngryA}You smash the lock.  {ThinkingA}Then what if it turns out you're wrong?   {ThinkingB}You just fucked your chance to get a good meal in those kids you're trying to protect.  {SurpriseA}Use your head, Kenny.
128) LEE
[pickup2]{Body-B}{ThinkingA}What?
129) KENNY
[pickup2]{Body-D}{AngryA}Look, {ThinkingA}that guy with Katjaa...  What's-his-name.  {DisgustA}He locked it up real TIGHT the second we came in.  [conspiratorially closer]I definitely heard a noise back there, Lee.
130) KENNY
[pickup2]{Body-D}{AngryB}My point is, we gotta know for sure.
131) KENNY
[pickup2][friendly joshing] {Body-D}{HappyA}All right, professor.  {ThinkingA}What do you have in mind?
132) LEE
[pickup2]{Body-B}{ThinkingB}Let me have a look at what we're dealing with first.
133) KENNY
[pickup2][sardonic] {AngryA}What's YOUR genius idea, {Body-D}professor?
134) KENNY
[pickup2]{Body-D}{AngryB}That's the second time {Body-HandsHips}you called me stupid, Lee.  {DisgustA}I'm gettin' kind sick of it.
135) KENNY
[pickup2]{SadB} Jesus, man!  I'm from Florida!  {DisgustA}Crazy shit just comes out of my mouth sometimes.  {SurprisedA}Sorry.
136) LEE
[pickup2] {Body-B}{SurpriseA}No. [beat while he considers the implication] No!  {ThinkingB}Why would you say that?
137) LEE
[pickup2] {AngryA}Oh, you are NOT saying what I {ThinkingA}think you're saying.
138) KENNY
[pickup2] [anxious] {Body-D}{NormalC}Hey.  Lee.  {ThinkingA}You know how to pick a lock, right?
139) KENNY
[pickup2] {FearA}Well.  You're... {SadB}you know... {ThinkingA}urban?
140) LEE
[pickup2] [subsequent inspections]  {Body-B}{AngryA}Pretty sturdy.
141) LEE
[pickup2][just had a breakthrough thought] {Body-B}{ThinkingA}Hm!
142) KENNY
[pickup2]{Body-D}{SurprisedA}What?
143) LEE
[pickup2]{ThinkingB}See those screws?  {HappyA}Instead of breaking the padlock, we can just take off the assembly, have a peek inside, {ThinkingA}and then replace it all again, like nothing ever happened.
144) KENNY
[pickup2]{HappyB}All right.  Sounds like you got a plan.  {ThinkingA}I'll hang around and keep an eye on that guy with the cow.
145) LEE
[pickup2]{NormalD}Andy.
146) KENNY
[pickup2]{DisgustA}Shit.  {FearB}I thought that {SurprisedA}was Danny.  {AngryA}Whatever.
147) LEE
[pickup2][subsequent inspections] [looking at the lock assembly] {Body-B}{ThinkingB}Screws holding it to the door.  {ThinkingA}If I can remove 'em, I don't even need to deal with the lock.
148) LEE
[pickup2]{Body-B}{ThinkingA}Kenny thought he heard a noise
149) LEE
[pickup2]{Body-B}{HappyA}Just checking out the barn here.  {HappyB}Never been to a dairy farm before.
150) LEE
[pickup2]{Body-B}{ThinkingA}What's behind this door, Andy?
151) ANDY
[pickup2]Just tools.  We keep it locked so the people in the woods don't try and grab 'em.  We'd be dead without our tools.
152) ANDY
[pickup2]{HappyA}Well, we're all sure glad his wife is here.  {NormalC}She's a lifesaver-- {HappyB}you got no idea.
153) ANDY
[pickup2]{Body-A}{ThinkingA}He's a little jumpy, eh?
154) ANDY
[pickup2]{Body-A}{HappyA}Okay.  Well, don't just roam around without me or Danny.  {NormalC}The farm can be a dangerous place.
155) ANDY
[pickup2]{ThinkingA}You know, the bandits and all.  {NormalB}Sorry about your friend.
156) ANDY
[pickup2]Hey, uh...  do me a favor.  Don't fuck around with this door.  Just, you know, Mama gets nervous.
157) ANDY
[pickup2]{NormalC}No problem!  {HappyB}Right away, doc!
158) KATJAA
[pickup2][calling across the barn] {Body-Sit}{FearA}Andrew!  I need your help again.

164) LEE
[pickup2]{Body-B}{FearA}Uh... [hems a bit] {ThinkingA}when do you think, {FearA}uh, {SadA}we might eat?
165) ANDY
[pickup2][reluctant]{Body-A}{SurprisedA}Yeah.  {ThinkingA}He, uh, {HappyA}probably talks a little more than he oughta.
166) LEE
[pickup2]{Body-B}{SadA}We met this woman up in the woods.  {ThinkingA}She seemed to know your brother.
167) ANDY
[pickup2]{Body-A}{NormalC}Yup.
168) LEE
[pickup2]{Body-B}{HappyA}Thanks.
169) LEE

170) ANDY
[pickup2]{Body-A}{ThinkingA}For what?
171) LEE
[pickup2]{SadA}Uhh... {FearA}never mind.
172) LEE
[pickup2]{Body-B}{ThinkingB}Why do you lock that door?
173) ANDY
[pickup2]Cuz we can't afford to lose our shit to the people In the woods.  They come down here every once in a while, raid our stuff.  Even with the fence.
174) ANDY
[pickup2]{Body-A}{NormalC}All righty, then.
175) ANDY
[pickup2]  {Body-A}{HappyA}No problem.
176) LEE
[pickup2]It's a small tool box.
177) LEE
[pickup2]Brenda must use this thing for household repairs.
178) LEE
[pickup2]I wonder if they keep a screwdriver in there.
179) LEE
[pickup2]Multi-tool.  That should be handy.
180) LEE
[pickup_2]Just gonna borrow this for a second.
181) KENNY
[pickup2]I got a quick look.  {FearA}They got boxes of stuff.  {FearB}And something metal and sharp.
182) ANDY

183) LEE
[pickup_2]{Body-B}{ThinkingA}Danny mentioned he needed something.
184) LEE
[pickup_2]{FearA}Shit, I can't remember now.  Sorry.
185) LEE
[pickup_2]{Body-B}{ThinkingA}Danny needs something again.
186) ANDY
[pickup_2][huge sigh]{Body-A}{HappyA}...  All right, all right.  {NormalB}Be right back, doc.
187) LEE
[pickup_2]{NormalB}Naw, {NormalA}not that important.
188) ANDY
[pickup_2]{Body-A}{ThinkingA}If you need something, {HappyA}tell me what it is, {HappyB}and I can get it for ya.
189) LEE
[pickup_2]{Body-B}{ThinkingA}So... {HappyA}Where do you keep the rest of the tools?
190) LEE
[pickup_2]{Body-B}{ThinkingB}I'm not gonna take the lock apart.

206) LEE
[pickup_2]{Body-B}{ThinkingA}Look.  {SurpriseA}I just came in and found the door open like that.
207) ANDY
[pickup_2] {Body-A}{ThinkingA}Look.  We have food here, but {HappyB}Danny and I still gotta do a lot of hunting to keep everyone fed.  {NormalA}When we catch something in the woods, we skin it and dress it back there.  {ThinkingA}Mama doesn't like us to make a mess in the house.  {NormalB}So you see?  {HappyA}Nothin' to worry about.
208) LEE
[pickup_2]{ThinkingA}No. She went in the house.
