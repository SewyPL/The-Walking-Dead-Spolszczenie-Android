1) DANNY
{normalC}Remember: we're just doing reconnaissance for now. No use getting ourselves killed.
2) DANNY
{normalC}What do you think of the place?
3) LEE
{normalA}It's beautiful.
4) LEE
{normalC}How?
5) DANNY
{normalC}It's cool.  {normalB}You don't have to decide right now.  {normalA}But don't wait too long, or you may not have a choice.
6) DANNY
[pickup2] {normalA}Hi ya, Trigger.
7) DANNY
[pickup2] {normalA}Glad I got to use her today.
8) DANNY
[pickup2] {normalA}My girl, here.
9) DANNY
[pickup2] {normalA}Hello.
10) 
You really like that gun.
14) LEE
{normalA}[pickup2] You really like that gun.
11) 
What's with the wheelbarrow?
12) 
This place is isolated.
13) 
You run this place with just one cow?
15) DANNY
[pickup2] {normalA}What's not to like?
16) 
Not much, I guess.
20) LEE
[pickup2] {normalA}Not much, I guess.
17) 
It's just a gun.
22) LEE
[pickup2] {normalA}It's just a gun.
18) 
Just kinda creepy, that's all.
23) LEE
[pickup2] {normalA}Just kinda creepy, that's all.
19) DANNY
[pickup2] {normalA}Exactly.
21) DANNY
[pickup2] {normalA}That's where you're wrong. This is Charlotte. She's as faithful as a starvin' hound when you got a bone in your pocket.
24) DANNY
[pickup2] {normalA}Times like these, a .243 will keep you warmer at night than any lady I ever known.
25) DANNY
[pickup2] Things happen on a dairy. Cut myself darn bad just the other day. Blood everywhere.
26) DANNY
[pickup2] I'm tough.
27) LEE
[pickup2] I saw a wheelbarrow over there, full of garbage. Some bloody clothes.
28) LEE
[pickup2] You seem okay.
29) LEE
[pickup2] You guys are pretty out in the sticks, here.
30) LEE
[pickup2] You get many visitors?
31) DANNY
[pickup2] Not anymore. Bandits, of course. Used to get these school kids on tours back before the dead time.
32) DANNY
[pickup2] [creepy] [we are] Hard to find.
33) LEE
[pickup2] [a little on edge]That right?
34) DANNY
{normala}{body-a}[pickup2] Used to have more. They get hungry, too. Or sick. Got your doctor friend here now, though.
35) LEE
{normala}{body-a}[pickup2] How do you run this place with just one cow?
36) LEE
[pickup2] You guys must trade for a LOT of fuel to keep the generators running, right?
37) DANNY
[pickup2] People get hungry and a few loaves of bread fetch a high price. Ya'll are lucky you're on this side of the deal now.
38) DANNY
{normala}{body-a}[pickup2] It'll be a good one.
39) LEE
{normala}{body-a}[pickup2] I'm going to go wait for supper, then.
