4) DUCK
[excited] {HappyB}Barbecue! Wow...
5) ANDY
{HappyA}Excuse the mess. {DisgustA}We had to {ThinkingA}block the back door after {AngryA}a walker got upstairs.
6) ANDY
{HappyB}Don't worry, {NormalB}that was a while ago and {ThinkingA}they ain't been back inside since.
7) LEE
[to himself]{ThinkingA}Looks unused.  {ThinkingB}Maybe a guest bed.
8) LEE
[to himself]{NormalC}Getting late.  {HappyB}No sign of bandits, though.
9) LEE
[to himself]{ThinkingB}I guess someone needed {SadA}some first aid recently.

15) ANDY
[ambient conversation]What do you do for a living, Ken?
16) KENNY
[ambient conversation]I.. uh... I was a fisherman down in Fort Lauderdale.
17) DANNY
[ambient conversation]If we were lucky we'd bring in a Sturgeon or two, but man... Never been out in the deep sea.
18) DANNY
[ambient conversation]Man, that sounds nice! Daddy used to take us out for largemouth bass when we were kids.
19) KENNY
[ambient conversation]Commercially, Snapper and Yellowfin mostly. But in the summers I'd take tourists out for some sailfish!
20) KENNY
[ambient conversation]I tell ya, there ain't nothing like fresh tuna straight from the sea - to the grill - to the plate!!  Especially the way Kat cooks it up!
21) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]I met Ken after I opened my Veterinary office. He came in with a sick octopus!
22) KENNY
[ambient conversation]What?  Where else was i gonna take it?
23) DANNY
[ambient conversation]Where ya from Katjaa?  That accent sure ain't from Georgia!
24) KATJAA
[ambient conversation][friendly]No, definitely not!  My family is from Latvia, but we moved to Florida when I was in my teens.
25) KENNY
[ambient conversation]Dan, did you always work here at the dairy?
26) DANNY
[ambient conversation]Me?  No, that was Daddy's business.  I ran an insurance company over in Decatur.
27) KENNY
[ambient conversation]I hear that.
28) DANNY
[ambient conversation]Yeah, anyway, it was good business.  But then all this shit went down, and I had to come home.  Family's more important, ya know?
29) ANDY
[ambient conversation]Yeah, well Dan felt it would be best to get away from Macon for a while. Had some... trouble.
30) LILLY
[ambient conversation]Decatur?
31) ANDY
[ambient conversation]Well, I took over as business manager eventually. Put that college degree to work.
32) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]What did you do before that?
33) ANDY
[ambient conversation]	I had a real estate business, but, you know... in this economy...
34) DANNY
[ambient conversation]Yeah, Daddy always wanted you to take over anyway.
35) ANDY
[ambient conversation]Just worked out that way, Dan.
36) LARRY
[ambient conversation]How long ya had this Dairy?
37) ANDY
[ambient conversation]Long as I can remember.  We grew up here.  Dan and I helped out where we could, but really this was a Mom and Pop business.
38) LILLY
[ambient conversation]So you two didn't work here?
39) ANDY
[ambient conversation]	So how long you been a vet?
40) DANNY
[ambient conversation]You work with many farm animals?
41) KATJAA
[ambient conversation][trying to think back] Ooh... well... a long time now.
42) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]Early in my training I did, but then mostly it was household pets.
43) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]I started working in a vet's office in my twenties, then got my license a few years later.
44) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]Oh, yes. Wildlife Rescue Center was always bringing their injured alligators to me to get patched up before releasing them.
45) DUCK
[ambient conversation]And alligators!
46) CLEMENTINE
[ambient conversation]Nu uh!
47) LILLY
[ambient conversation]So that fence does a good job of keeping the walkers out?
48) DUCK
[ambient conversation]Once, my dad smashed one in the face with a TV!
49) DUCK
[ambient conversation]Sorry.
50) ANDY
[ambient conversation]Yeah. Unfortunately we lost most of our livestock before we managed to get the thing rigged up.
51) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]Kenny Jr!  That is not appropriate talk at the dinner table.
52) DANNY
[ambient conversation][mumbled]Damned walkers.
53) KENNY
[ambient conversation]Our hunting trips have turned up nothing. The walkers are eating anything living they can get their teeth into.
54) DANNY
[ambient conversation]	Well, ya just have to know what to hunt.  There's meat out there that'll keep you alive if ya know what to look for.
55) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]Thanks again for this meal.  You have no idea how long it's been!
56) KENNY
[ambient conversation]How've you folks managed to find food?
57) ANDY
[ambient conversation]And what do you do Miss Lilly?
58) LARRY
[ambient conversation]	Lilly's a military woman.  Takes after her old man.
59) DANNY
[ambient conversation]That right?  Ever see any action?
60) LILLY
[ambient conversation][blunt, emotionless]I have.
61) LARRY
[ambient conversation]	Son, you don't ever ask a soldier that question, ya got it?
62) LARRY
[ambient conversation]All you need to know is that you don't wanna fuck with her. Period.
63) LILLY
[ambient conversation]Dad...
64) DANNY
[ambient conversation]Yeah, I'm sorry.
65) ANDY
[ambient conversation]	Don't pay my brother no mind.  I swear he makes a hobby of chewing his own foot.
66) ANDY
[ambient conversation]So did ya'all know each other before the outbreak?
67) LILLY
[ambient conversation]No. We just sort of found ourselves thrown together.
68) LILLY
[ambient conversation]But now we've gotta stick together if we're gonna survive.
69) ANDY
[ambient conversation]	I hear ya.  Ya gotta know when to make sacrifices for the greater good, ya know.
70) KENNY
[ambient conversation]It ain't right, though.  No kid should have to see the things they've seen.
71) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]Kids are resilient, you know?  I hate that this is the way they have to grow up, but under the circumstances, I think they're doing well.
72) DANNY
[ambient conversation]How the kids been dealing with... everything?
73) DANNY
[ambient conversation]Maybe I should check on him?
74) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]Let the man clean up. He'll be done in a minute.
75) DUCK
[ambient conversation]Are we gonna eat soon, momma?
76) LARRY
[ambient conversation]How long does it take to wash your damn hands?
77) KATJAA
[ambient conversation]As soon as Lee gets back.
78) ANDY
[ambient conversation]Yeah, Maybelle is the only one we have left.
79) DANNY
[ambient conversation][cont.] She provides the milk.
80) CLEMENTINE
[ambient conversation]I like your cow.  She's pretty.
81) DANNY
[ambient conversation]That's why we need Katjaa's help.
82) DANNY
[ambient conversation]We'd love to have another healthy calf, but we mostly want to make sure Maybelle's okay.
83) LEE

97) ANDY

98) LEE
[pickup1][calling back - having found the bathroom]{AngryA}Yep. Can't miss it.
99) DANNY
[pickup1][calling out from offscreen]You find the bathroom okay, Lee?
100) LEE
[pickup1][looking with minimal interest at portraits of the Brothers] {thinkingB}Hm.
101) LEE
