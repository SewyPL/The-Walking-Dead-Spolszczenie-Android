292) LARRY
[pickup2][Normal tone of voice] Yeah, I wanna attract their attention [...up to a yell] so I can fucking kill them!
293) LEE
[pickup2][softly, trying to reason with him]C'mon, Larry.  Do you really want to attract their attention?
294) KENNY
[pickup2]They've got Katjaa and Duck, Lee! Those fuckers have my family!
295) LEE

328) LEE
[pickup2][urgent. to Lilly as he tries to help her dying dad] Is he breathing at all?
329) LILLY
[pickup2][frantic, but happy that Lee has chosen to help her.] No, no I don't think so.
330) LEE
[pickup2][handing lilly the nitro pills - Urgent]Here.  I found these inside the house.

338) KENNY
[pickup2][after killing Larry in an incredibly cold hearted manner and suprising way, Kenny instantly goes into a remorseful yet defensive mode. (Quick delivery)] I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!  I just-  It had to be done!
509) KENNY
[pickup2][after killing Larry in an incredibly cold hearted manner and suprising way, Kenny instantly goes into a remorseful yet defensive mode. (Quick delivery)] I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!  I just-  It had to be done!

508) LILLY
[pickup2][Kenny smashed Larrys head while Lilly is trying to revive him.  SCREAMING!!]  NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!
341) LARRY
[pickup2][quiet grunt of impact as Lee gives CPR.  Is the CPR helping or is Larry becoming a zombie?]
342) LARRY
[pickup2][quiet quick inhale on impact as Lee gives CPR.  Is the CPR helping or is Larry becoming a zombie?]
343) KENNY
[after killing Larry in an incredibly cold hearted manner and suprising way, Kenny instantly goes into a remorseful yet defensive mode.] Yes I do, Lee!! And so do you! [frustrated that he's now in this alone and disapointed in Lee]I was counting on you, man.
344) LEE
[pickup2][furious that Kenny just smashed in Larry's head!! "It had to be done!"]You don't know that!!
348) LEE
[pickup2][exerting force, trying to remove a large screw by hand.] It's not coming off that way.
355) LEE
[pickup2][exerting force, trying to remove a large screw by hand.] It's not coming off that way.
349) LEE
[pickup2][trying to find a way to get the AC unit off the wall]If we can remove these screws, the AC should come down easily.
354) LEE
[pickup2][trying to find a way to get the AC unit off the wall]If we can remove these screws, the AC should come down easily.
350) KENNY
[pickup2][Helping Lee take down the AC, making sure the unit is still steady after the first screw was removed]You got it?
351) LEE
[pickup2][confirming that he still has the AC ballanced after taking out the first screw] Yeah. One more should do it.
352) LEE
[Pickup2][Trying to take down the AC unit but Kenny is being an ASS about it] Just keep the damn thing steady.
353) KENNY
[pickup2][Reluctantly helping lee take down the AC, but ONLY because he wants to get the hell out of there and save his family] Hurry the fuck up, Lee! We don't have all day here.
356) LEE
[pickup2][quickly ushering Clementine back into the (relatively) safe room.  Rushed and hushed.]Are you okay?!  Did anyone see you?
357) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2][Clem quietly asures Lee that she's okay.] No. [No one saw me, but-]But there's a man outside.
358) KENNY
[pickup2][calling out from the next room, but trying to be relatively quiet, not attracting attention]Lee!  I can see him.
359) LEE
[pickup2][hushed, but anoyed that Kenny is ready to just take off on his own.]Where the hell are you going?
360) KENNY
[pickup2][quiet, but angry.  Still hurt that Lee turned his back on him] What do you care?
361) LEE
[pickup2][quiet, but irritated as Kenny irrationally storms out of the room.] Kenny!
362) LEE
[pickup2][Lilly is NOT Lee's friend.  But Lee still tries to convince Lilly that she cant stay here, while attempting to be sympathetic]Lilly.  We gotta go.
363) LILLY
[pickup2][rather shellshocked and emotionless after Lee helped Kenny kill her dad] Leave me alone.
364) LEE
[pickup2][Lilly is NOT Lee's friend.  But Lee still tries to convince Lilly that she cant stay here, while attempting to be sympathetic]It's not safe in here-
365) LILLY
[pickup2][rather shellshocked and emotionless after Lee helped Kenny kill her dad, but with anger] For God's sake Lee, I didn't even get to say goodbye!
366) LEE
[pickup2][ As Lee exits into the back room, he turns again to clem.]Stay here.  Take care of Lilly, okay?
367) LEE
[pickup2][Hearing Kenny choosing weapons in the next room]Shit.  He's gonna get us all killed.
368) LEE
[pickup2][Lee tries to convince Lilly that she cant stay here after Kenny has killed her dad while Lee was trying to help]Lilly.  I'm sorry, we've gotta go.
369) LILLY
[pickup2][rather shellshocked and emotionless after  Kenny killed her dad] I know.  I just need a minute to say goodbye.
370) KENNY
[pickup2][processess - In the next room][spoken to himself as he chooeses a weapon from a variety of kinives & Torture equipment] Yeah.  This is good.
371) LILLY
[somber- still crushed after the killing of her dad, but recognies that Lee tried to help.  Stops lee for a moment just as he's about to leave her alone] Hey.  We're good.  Okay?
372) LEE
[pickup2][bleary] Is there a way out?
378) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2]Lee!
491) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2]Lee!
379) LEE
[pickup2][still coming out of his daze, attempting to console]No, Clem. It doesn't work like that...
380) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2][wretched]It was Mark!  I ate part of Mark!  Does that mean I'm gonna turn into...?
381) LARRY
[pickup2][accusing] If he woulda stopped us in time...!
382) LILLY
C'mon, Dad.  Now's not the time.
388) LILLY
C'mon, Dad.  Now's not the time.
383) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2][wretched]It... it was a person! I ate meat from a person! Does that mean I'm gonna turn into...?
384) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2][wretched]It-it was Mark!  They tried to make us eat Mark!
385) LEE
[pickup2][still coming out of daze, consoling]But you didn't do it...
386) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2]No...
387) LARRY
[pickup2]The rest of us did, God damnit!  If you hadn't dragged your feet...
389) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2][wretched]It-it was a person!  They tried to make us eat a person!
390) LARRY
[pickup2][furious, to the rest of the group]That evil fucker INVITED me to eat the meat, and all the time he knew what it was...
391) LILLY
[pickup2][to Larry, not of warning]Stay calm, Dad.  We'll deal with it later.
392) LARRY
[pickup2][angry, of course]Yeah... THROUGH THIS FUCKIN' DOOR!
393) LARRY
[pickup2][sarcastic]That's right, moron--you crawl off to the corner and think.  Leave the rest of us the hell alone!
394) LEE
[pickup2]We gotta think...
395) LARRY
[pickup2]This goddamn thumbsucker was the one who brought us here!
396) KENNY
[pickup2]Will you all just shut the fuck up?!
397) LEE
[pickup2][low, to Clem]Don't be.  It's gonna be okay...I'm gonna find us a way out of here...
399) LARRY
[pickup2]I'll rip your goddamn heads off and make you swallow 'em!
400) LARRY
[ranting]Try to feed us one of our own men for dinner? Crazy fucking cannibals!
401) LARRY
[ranting]Try to feed us human flesh for dinner? Crazy fucking cannibals!
402) LARRY
[pickup2][low and menacing]What the hell is your problem?
403) LEE
[pickup2][offhand but cutting] Guess your new girlfriend wasn't all she was cracked up to be.
404) LARRY
[pickup2][low and menacing]You refused to give me my day's rations back at the motor lodge...
405) LARRY
[pickup2][low and menacing]You were a prick back at the motor lodge...
406) LARRY
[pickup2][low and menacing]Then you practically fuckin' push my face into that goddamn human barbeque.
407) LARRY
[pickup2][low and menacing] ...and you went out of your way to be an asshole to me tonight.
408) LARRY
[pickup2][low and menacing] You must really hate me.
409) LEE
[pickup2][defiant]No... you're not worth the energy to hate....
410) LEE
[pickup2]I'm not your enemy, Larry.
411) LARRY
[pickup2][low and menacing] I don't believe you.
412) LARRY
[pickup2][low and menacing]But guess what? You're stuck with me.  I plan to be around long after you're gone. And if you turn...
413) LARRY
[pickup2][very intimate]I'll be the one to put the axe through your skull.
414) LARRY
[pickup2]Open up, goddamnit!
415) LILLY
[pickup2][scandalized] Dad!!
416) LEE
[pickup2][to himself] Fuck it.
417) KENNY
[pickup2][hopeful]Think we could heave it through the door?
418) LEE
[pickup2][to himself]Could there be a hole behind these pallets...?
419) LEE
[pickup2]No such luck.
420) LEE
[pickup2][to himself]What's this...some kind of vent?
421) LEE
[pickup2][to himself]Too small to do us any good.
422) LEE
[pickup2][to himself]But there's no way out through the ceiling.
423) LEE
[pickup2][to himself]Shelves are pretty sturdy. We could climb up...
424) LILLY
[pickup2][concerned]Easy...
425) LARRY
[pickup2][in pain] Aah!
426) LARRY
[pickup2][ranting]I'll break the damn door down!
427) LILLY
[pickup2][alarmed]Dad!  You can't get--
428) LEE
[pickup2][to himself]I wonder.... [louder, to the group]There ought to be an air duct behind this unit... maybe big enough for one of us to fit through....
429) KENNY
[pickup2][dubious] I dunno, Lee... seems like a longshot.
430) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2][hopeful]Does the air-conditioner come off?
431) LEE
[pickup2][examining the unit]I think I could take it off... if I had something to remove the screws...
432) LEE
[pickup2][crestfallen]Of course they took it. Shit.
433) LEE
[pickup2][remembering]The multitool!
434) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2][hopeful]Maybe there's something else we could use.  I've got a rock.
435) LEE
[pickup2]A rock won't help... [thinks]but a COIN might do the trick.  Do you have a coin?
436) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2][disappointed]Uh-uh...
437) LEE
[pickup2][to himself]That air-duct is our best bet for getting out of here!
438) LEE
[pickup2][to himself]I just need a coin or something to remove the screws...
439) LEE
[pickup2][to himself]Just gotta remove these screws and get this unit off...
440) LEE
[pickup2][biting the bullet, slowly and clearly]I think I may have found a way out of here.  But I need something to remove the screws on the air-conditioner.
441) LILLY
[pickup2][flatly]No.
442) LEE
[pickup2][uncomfortable]If you had something I could use as a screwdriver...a coin or something...
443) LEE
[pickup2][uncomfortable]What about HIM?  Look, I know this is a terrible time for it, but...
444) LEE
[pickup2][continuing, uncomfortable]...back at the Motor Inn, Larry mentioned something about keeping coins in his pockets...
445) LEE
[pickup2][continuing, uncomfortable]...if there's a chance Larry has a coin or something in one of his pockets...it might be the thing that saves our lives.
446) LILLY
[pickup2][under her breath] Fucking vulture...
447) LEE
But if we're gonna get out of here, we need your help.  And Larry's...
449) LEE
But if we're gonna get out of here, we need your help.  And Larry's...
451) LEE
But if we're gonna get out of here, we need your help.  And Larry's...
448) LEE
[pickup2][with sympathy]I'm sorry, Lilly...
450) LEE
[pickup2][with sympathy]I'm sorry, Lilly...
452) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2][Lee has asked Clem to stay and take care of Lilly (after Lillys farther has died] I will.
453) KENNY
[pickup2][calling out from the next room, but trying to be relatively quiet, not attracting attention] Get in here, I got an idea.
454) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2][still sniffling]Like what?
455) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2][more sobbing]
456) LEE
[pickup2][consoling]Shh... I know, I know. But you gotta be strong right now. I need you to be strong. Think about something else... something hopeful.
457) LEE
[pickup3][somber - comforthing Clementine after larry's death]Getting out of here.
458) LEE
[pickup3][somber - comforthing Clementine after larry's death]Someplace safe, where no monsters can get you.
459) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2]Sometimes.
460) LEE
[pickup3][The new read should be more somber]How about your walkie-talkie... those pretend talks with your Mom and Dad.  Don't those make you feel better?
461) LEE
[pickup2][consoling her] I'm workin' on it!
462) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2][shyly]We're gonna get out, right? You found a way out?
463) LEE
[pickup2]They didn't hurt you, did they?
464) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2][answering in the negative]Mm-mm.
465) LEE
[pickup2]The air-conditioner... there might be a duct behind it....
466) KENNY
[pickup2][distracted, not listening] Oh God!  What're they doin' to Katjaa and Duck...?
467) LEE
[pickup2]If the duct behind the air-conditioner is big enough, we might've found our way out of here...
468) KENNY
[pickup2][hopeful] Yeah?
469) LEE
[pickup2] But I need something to loosen the screws.
470) KENNY
[disappointed]I got nothin'. [to himself]Shit!
471) LEE
[pickup2]Hang tight... maybe I can scrounge something.
472) KENNY
[pickup2]Well shit, man, go see if you can get the bolts off!
473) LEE
[pickup2] I got a coin off Larry!
484) LEE
[pickup2] I got a coin off Larry!
474) 
You wanna search Larry's pockets?
477) 
You wanna search Larry's pockets?
475) 
The air-conditioner might be our way out.
479) LEE
[pickup2][half to himself]The air-conditioner!
480) 
I need a coin or something...
481) LEE
[pickup2][insistent]Listen, I need a coin or something.
482) LEE
[pickup2][more insistent]It's important!  It could get us out of here!
483) KENNY
[pickup2][surly]Well, I got nothin'.
485) KENNY
[pickup2][surly]So... go fuckin' loosen the bolts, if you think that'll help.
