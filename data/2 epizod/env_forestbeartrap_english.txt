50) LEE
[pickup2] [hunting with Mark in the woods, after losing a rabbit] {disgustA} A rabbit's hardly a meal, Mark,  but... I'd take it. We're all hungry.
51) MARK
[pickup2][Responding to "We need something that will feed all of us"] {thinkingA} No kidding.
52) MARK
[pickup2] [cont] {disgustA} Last night I heard your friend Doug laying in bed just naming types of pie. It was driving me nuts. I think he's starting to lose it.
53) LEE
[pickup2] {thinkingA} He's not the only one. Won't you cut him some slack.
54) LEE
[pickup2] {thinkingA} We're all on edge. Just cut her some slack.
55) MARK
[pickup2] {disgustA} When I accidentally grabbed for Carley's rations the other night, I thought she was gonna take off my hand!
56) MARK
[pickup2][agreeing that the lack of food is making everyone on egde] {normalB} Yeah, you're right.  [frustrated] {disgustB} I wish I knew for sure how much food we have left.
57) LEE
[pickup2] {disgustA}{body-crouchAxe} You'll have to ask Lilly.  She's the one handling the rations.
58) LEE
[pickup2] {sadA}{body-crouchAxe} Not enough.  According to Lilly we've just about hit the last of our food reserves. {thinkingA} Some people might have to go without tonight.
59) LEE

64) LEE
[pickup2] {disgustB} She thinks everyone should have an equal chance of missing a meal.
65) MARK
[pickup2] {disgustB}{body-crouchRifle} You mean "Lilly's Lottery" again. {disgustA} Kenny's gonna be pissed.
66) 
You'll have to ask Lilly.
67) MARK
[pickup2] {disgustA}{body-crouchRifle} Maybe. You know some people aren't too happy about the way Lilly is handling rations.
68) LEE
[pickup2] {thinkingB} Lilly knows it's important to keep the adults fed and functioning. {disgustA} Sometimes that means someone's gotta miss a meal.
69) MARK
[pickup2][responding to lee's silence when asked "How much food is left?"] {disgustA}{body-crouchRifle} ...That much, huh? {sadA} Does Kenny know?

71) MARK
[pickup2] {angryA} Yeah, between the lack of food and Kenny & Lilly fighting all the time, {sadA} things are getting pretty tense back at the Motor Inn.
72) MARK
[pickup2] {thinkingA} You know Kenny's been talking about taking off if he can get that RV running.
73) LEE
[pickup2] {normalD}{body-crouchAxe} I sure hope so. [hoping kenny is having better luck hunting for food]
74) MARK
[pickup2] {normalA}{body-crouchRifle} You think Kenny's having any more luck than we are out here?
75) MARK
[pickup2] {sadA}{body-crouchRifle} Can't blame him, though - {disgustA} did you hear Larry going off on him last night? {thinkingB} What's the old guy's deal, anyway? {normalB} Seems like he's got a problem with you in particular.
76) 
He thinks I'm dangerous.

He's an old racist asshole.
78) 
He's just looking out for his daughter.

I have no idea.
80) LEE
[pickup2][Responding to "What's Larry's deal"?] {disgustA}{body-crouchAxe} He thinks I'm a danger to the group {thinkingB} and Clementine.
81) MARK
[pickup2] {thinkingB}{body-crouchRifle} I think he's the one putting us in danger. {angryA} The way Lilly worries about his health, I wouldn't be surprised if she's been skimming rations for him.
82) LEE
[pickup2][Responding to "What's Larry's deal"?] {angryA}{body-crouchAxe} He's just an old racist asshole, that's his deal.
83) MARK
[pickup2] {angryA}{body-crouchRifle} Well, he needs to get over that and start finding a way to pull his weight. {thinkingA} Heart problems or not, we should all be out here trying to find food.
84) MARK
[pickup2] {thinkingA}{body-crouchRifle} Hey, I know Lilly. {angryA} She can take care of herself. {thinkingA} He needs to take that energy and put it towards finding us some more food.
85) LEE

87) MARK
[pickup2] {thinkingA}{body-crouchRifle} Maybe that's just the way he is, {angryA}but that guy needs to chill out.
88) LEE
