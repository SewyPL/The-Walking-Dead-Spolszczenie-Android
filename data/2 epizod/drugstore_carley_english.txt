{ThinkingA}{body-A}How'd you end up here?
17) CARLEY
{SadA}She was an asshole, but, {SadB}you know.
18) LEE

{SadA}{body-C}Yeah.
21) LEE
{SadB}{body-C}I'm sorry.
22) CARLEY
{SadA}My news editor was eaten about five feet away from me, and {FearA}I would've joined her if it wasn't for that {SadA}dorky guy on watch over there.
23) 
You handle yourself well.
24) 
That guy saved you?
25) LEE
{DisgustB}{body-C}That guy saved you?

{HappyA}He's kind of cute, {ThinkingA}in that parent's basement sort of way.
29) CARLEY
{HappyB}{body-B}Yeah, can you believe it? {FearA}Those creeps, or-or ghouls or {AngryB}whatever the hell they are, they were pulling our van apart and that guy, {FearA}Doug, {HappyA}just came to the rescue.
30) CARLEY
{FearA}Huh? {HappyA}Oh...nothing.
31) CARLEY
{ThinkingB}Right.
32) CARLEY

[pickup1] Couldn't figure it out, huh?
77) LEE
[pickup3] Yeah, give it a try.
78) CARLEY
[pickup1] Eh, I'll keep trying.
79) LEE

82) LEE
[pickup3] I can try to find some. Needs two.
83) CARLEY

84) LEE
[pickup3] You know there are no batteries in that thing.
85) CARLEY
[pickup1] Thanks, I wouldn't even really know what to look for.

Alright then.
101) LEE
[pickup3] You don't have to be... it's traumatic.
102) CARLEY
[pickup1] I'm sure some people got out. Maybe they're all being rescued. Then again, maybe not.
103) LEE
[pickup3] You're really "fine"? All of your colleagues are probably dead.
104) CARLEY
[pickup1] You don't think I know that?!? Of course I'm not fucking fine! God, Lee. Just, leave me alone.
105) LEE
[pickup3] Alright, then. We don't need to talk about it.
