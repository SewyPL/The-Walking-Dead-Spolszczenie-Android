1) KENNY
{sadA}Hey, {normalB}they said Mark got attacked?
2) LEE
{normalD}Don't worry, he's fine.
3) KENNY
{normalB}He'd better be. We need him.
4) LEE
{angryA}Bandits attacked us.
5) KENNY
{angryA}God dammit. {thinkingA}Didn't think they'd come all the way out here.
6) KENNY
{normalA}Least he didn't get bit, I guess.
7) LEE
{thinkingA}I haven't seen him since.
8) KENNY
{normalA}Hmm, should I ask Kat {normalB}to look in on him when she's done with the cow?
9) KENNY
{normalB}Maybe, maybe not. Once we get our food, we can do a better job of defending it.
10) KENNY
{thinkingA}Instead of just waitin' around at the motel for somebody to attack us or eat us.
11) LEE
{thinkingA}This place isn't safe.
12) LEE
{happyA}I'm glad you decided to come out with us.
13) KENNY
{normalB}Yeah, well, we need the food.  {normalA}Helping this cow better be worth it.
14) KENNY
[worried] {angryA}I noticed there weren't too many walkers around on the way up.
15) LEE
{normalD}That's good.
16) KENNY
{normalA}Is it? I got a bad feeling.
17) KENNY
{angryA}Whether it's from the walkers or the bandits, there's a shitstorm comin'.
18) LEE
{normalC}Something wrong with that?
19) KENNY
{angryA}If we ain't seeing 'em, that means either there's a shitload of 'em waiting somewhere...
20) KENNY
...or else somebody with a lot more firepower than us is killin' 'em off.
21) KENNY
{normalA}Either way, I gotta bad feeling a shitstorm's brewin'.
22) LEE
{normalD}The walkers don't worry me as much as the bandits.
23) KENNY
{normalB}That's what I'm sayin'.
24) KENNY
{fearA}Somethin's coming, Lee. There's gonna be a war.
25) KENNY
{sadA}On the way over here, I was gettin' dizzy, hands shakin', cold sweats. {normalA}Thought I was gonna pass out.
26) LEE
{normalD}They've got food here.
27) KENNY
{angryA}I hope they feed us, Lee. Soon.
28) KENNY
{thinkingA}Yeah, but I'm not just talking about one meal, ya know?
29) LEE
{normalC}How you holding up?
75) 
How you holding up?
30) KENNY
[quietly] {angryA}If they got a supply of food somewhere, {normalA}we've gotta know where it is and how to get it.
31) KENNY
[quietly] {sadA}In case something happens.
32) KENNY
{normalB}Katjaa knows what's up, talk to her and she'll show you where I'm talking about.
33) KENNY
{angryA}Find out what's in that room.
34) LEE
[quietly] {thinkingA}I still don't like it.
35) KENNY
{sadA}Come on, Lee, it's not just us. We've gotta think of the kids.
36) KENNY
[quietly] {normalB}You don't have to like it, just do it.
37) LEE
[quietly] {thinkingA}You're right.
38) LEE
[quietly] {normalB}It's probably nothing. {normalC}What could they be hiding at a dairy farm?
39) KENNY
[quietly] {thinkingA}Food!
40) LEE
[quietly] {angryA}These folks deserve their privacy.
41) KENNY
[quietly] {normalB}We just want to look, Lee. We're not stealing anything.
42) LEE
[quietly] {angryA}We can't piss these people off, Kenny. We need them to trust us.
43) KENNY
[quietly] {normalA}That goes both ways, Lee.
44) LEE
[quietly] {angryA}You want ME to take a look?
45) KENNY
[quietly] {normalB}Exactly.
46) LEE
{normalA}Bye.
47) KENNY
{happyA}Hey, Lee. {normalA}Nice place, huh?
48) KENNY
{normalA}So, uh... what's up?
49) KENNY
[after being ignored]{sadA}Well... just be careful, I guess.
50) LEE
{normalA}Hi, Kenny.
51) LEE
[greeting]{normalB}Hey...
86) LEE
[greeting]{normalB}Hey...
52) KENNY
[noticing Lee's silence]{angryA}You sense it too, don't ya?   {fearA}Man, I've got a feeling something bad is on the horizon, Lee.
53) KENNY
[responding to Lee's silence; hushed][quietly]  {angryA}Well don't look at me!  {thinkingA}I'm no good at breaking and entering.  But somebody's gotta do it!
54) KENNY
{normalB}What's up, Lee?
55) KENNY
[looks at Danny] {normalB}Mind if I talk to Lee for a minute?
56) KENNY
[looks at Danny] {normalB}Gimme a sec...
57) DANNY
{normalB}Yeah, go ahead.
58) LEE
[pickup2] I guess Lilly isn't too thrilled about being here.
59) KENNY
[pickup2] I could give two shits about what Lilly wants. Duck and Katjaa need food, and I'm not about to sit around that Motor Inn and watch them go hungry.
60) LEE
[pickup2] If everything works out, maybe he and Katjaa can have an easier life here.
61) KENNY
[pickup2][bitter]Yeah, right.
62) LEE
[pickup2] That's in the past, Kenny. A lot's happened since then.
63) KENNY
[pickup2] [bitter]That's funny, you didn't seem too worried about Duck when Larry wanted to throw him out into the street back in Macon.
64) KENNY
[pickup2] [bitter] That's funny, considering you didn't seem too worried about Duck back at Hershel's Farm.
65) KENNY
[pickup2] I hope you're right. Duck and Clementine deserve a better life than starving to death at some crappy motel.
66) LEE
[pickup2] I'm gonna go have a look around.
67) KENNY
[pickup2] I'll be here if you need me. Let me know if you find anything.
68) KENNY
[pickup2]Well, it wasn't easy. Duck didn't look so good on the walk over to this place.
69) LEE
[pickup2] Did Duck and Katjaa get here okay?
70) LEE
[pickup2]Kenny?
71) LEE
[pickup2] I still can't get that lock off the door.
72) KENNY
[pickup2][reminder] Hmmm.  You probably just need a screwdriver or something.
73) 
Lilly doesn't want to be here.
74) 
Your family made it here okay?
76) KENNY
[pickup3][follows # 310481005]You're with me on this, right?
77) LEE
[pickup3][agreeing with Kenny that Lilly is wrong about the motor inn]Yeah, of course.  Lilly's judgement is clouded, but you've got a pretty clear head about these things.
78) LEE
[pickup3][disagreeing with Kenny about the motor inn]Lilly's been doing a good job of keeping the group together.  You need to back off a bit.
79) LEE
[pickup3][not siding with anyone about the motor inn]You're not making me pick sides, Kenny.
80) KENNY
[pickup3][disapointed in Lee for siding with Lilly] Whatever.
81) KENNY
[pickup3][in ernest]Well... you better think about it, because that time is coming.
82) 
Yeah, of course.
83) 
No. Lilly's been doing a good job.
84) 
I'm not choosing sides.
85) KENNY
[pickup3][responding to Lee's silence and refusal to pick sides] Hmf.  Always the diplomat.
87) KENNY
[pickup3] Hey Lee, found anything interesting?
88) KENNY
[pickup3] Good to know. Keep your ears open for anything else that might help us.
89) LEE
[pickup3] I'm just trying to make sure this place is secure, in case we decide to make this a more long term solution.  Except for those people in the woods, it seems pretty safe.
90) KENNY
[pickup3] That's true.  Well, it's good to know what we're working with here.
91) KENNY
[pickup3] Keep looking around and let me know if you find anything else.
92) LEE
[pickup3] I was talking to Andy a bit earlier, it doesn't sound like they have too many guns around. They rely mostly on the fence to keep them safe.
93) LEE
[pickup3] Well that's the problem, when there's no more gas, there's no more fence.
94) KENNY
[pickup3] Hey Lee, how's it going with the St. Johns?
95) LEE
[pickup3] Good. I was talking to Andy earlier and offered our group's assistance on the dairy.
96) KENNY
[pickup3] Great. Sounds like they're starting to accept us.
97) LEE
[pickup3] Definitely.
98) LEE
[pickup3]I don't think they have much to protect them besides the fence so he seemed pretty appreciative.
99) KENNY
[pickup3] Yeah, this place is sure a step up from that shithole motor inn.
100) LEE
[pickup3] They seem like good people. If we play our cards right, I still think it could work out for us here.
101) KENNY
[pickup3] Don't wait too long to help scope out that bandit camp. It'd be a good opportunity to find a bit more out about the St. John's and their relationship with those... bandits or whatever.
102) LEE
[pickup3] Right. I'll see what I can find out.
103) LEE
[pickup3] Good idea.
104) KENNY
[pickup3] Don't wait too long to help scope out that bandit camp.  Sounds like they're pretty amped up about it. This might be a good way to earn their trust.
105) KENNY
[pickup3]So as long as you're on THIS side, things are all right.  Provided the fence holds out.
