95) LEE
{sadC}I barely knew you.
82) DOUG
{disgustA}Is that it? {happyB}Maybe you like to kill. {angryA}Maybe you like the control you get to take. {happyC}Is that what happened with Sam?
83) LEE
{thinkingA}You're better off, not having to starve to death with the rest of us.
98) LEE

105) KENNY
[fearing the worst/ hushed] {angryA} He didn't make it, did he?
106) MARK
[pickup2][just slightly irritated - at Motel Fence]Come on, Larry, give it a rest, man. Things are different -- being a racist is outdated.
107) MARK
[pickup2][slightly irritated - at Motel fence]Come on, Larry, give it a rest. I'm sure Lee is getting pretty sick of you thinking he's a danger to the group.
108) MARK
[pickup2][slightly irritated - at motel fence]Come on, Larry. What is it between you two?  Why do you have a personal grudge against Lee?
109) LARRY
[pickup2][slightly annoyed that Lee is talking about him behind his back- At motel fence] {angryA} Is that what you told him?
110) LEE
[pickup 2][ defensive when Larry accusing him of talking behind his back - at motel fence]Yeah, that's right.

115) LARRY
[pickup2][finding out that Lee's been talking behind his back - quietly threatening]No?  Then what did you mean?
116) MARK
[pickup2][stopping an argument between Lee & Larry]All right, let's take a step back. Maybe you two SHOULD keep your distance.
117) LARRY
[pickup2][irritated] Fine with me.

127) LARRY
[pickup2][About to go off on a tangent about Lee, but then thinks better of it, ]HE- ...  I just need some food.  Going this long without a proper meal will make anybody cranky.
128) LARRY
[pickup2][sneering at Lee during Motel Fence argument]He knows why.
129) LARRY
[pickup2][getting all up in Lee's face]And what are you gonna do about it?

[pickup2][talking to Lee at the Trck after David dies.  Follows "Let Kenny go, Kat"] But...
134) KATJAA
[pickup2][Slightly annoyed at Lee's reaction to Kenny storming off after Davids death]Don't be like that, Lee. I know we've all seen death.  But that doesn't make it any easier.
135) LEE
[pickup2][looking at the ice machine.  To himself]Ugh.  I hope Glenn didn't have to hide in here for very long.  It smells terrible.

What's his problem?
143) 
I'm sick of this shit, too.
144) LEE
[pickup2][Mirroring Kennys frustration over people alyways dying] I'm sick of this shit, too.
145) KATJAA
[pickup2][Responding to lee saying "Im sick of people dying!"] You don't think I am? [then conflicted]I don't know... Maybe it's for the best.  We're already struggling to feed our OWN kids.
146) KATJAA
[pickup2][after Kenny stors off, frustrated that people keep dying ][tired] I wish he wouldn't do that.

568) KATJAA
[pickup3]When you first brought him here you asked if I could fix him.  I'm not a doctor, Lee, I'm a vet.  You can't go putting people in danger and expect me to fix them.
569) KATJAA
[pickup3]That man you brought... I tried, but he was never going to survive.
570) KATJAA
[pickup3]You didn't answer me when I fisrt asked what happened out there.  Kenny said it didn't matter, but it does.  You can't let Kenny get into these messes.  I NEED him to come back, and not like this guy.
