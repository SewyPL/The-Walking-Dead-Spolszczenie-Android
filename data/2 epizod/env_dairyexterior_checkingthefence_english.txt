1) LEE
[context: let's go, you're going to be okay] Come on, man. We're clear.
2) BANDIT
[taunting] You lucky sons of bitches!  Go ahead and run! We ain't goin' nowhere!
275) BANDIT
[taunting] You lucky sons of bitches!  Go ahead and run! We ain't goin' nowhere!
3) MARK
Little help here, Lee?
4) MARK
C'mon, Lee, we don't have all day.
5) MARK
Damnit, Lee, I can't lift it myself.
6) BANDIT
Hehe, I got you!
7) BANDIT
There ya are!
10) BANDIT
There ya are!
8) LEE
[killed by arrow] Gahhhh!
9) BANDIT
I got you, you son of a bitch!
11) BANDIT
There you are, boy!
12) BANDIT
Don't think I can't see you!
13) BANDIT
I'll fuck you sumbitches up!
14) BANDIT
I see ya!
15) MARK
What do you think of this place, Lee?
16) LEE
It's a nice change from the motel.
17) MARK
You said it. Out here, it's almost like things used to be.
18) LEE
I don't plan on staying.
19) MARK
I could see myself staying here for a long time.
129) MARK
I could see myself staying here for a long time.
131) MARK
I could see myself staying here for a long time.
20) LEE
Still too early to tell.
21) LEE
Except for the zombies and bandits.
22) LEE
It'll never be like it used to be.
23) MARK
Yeah, these guys have lost as much as any of us.
24) MARK
The motel's not going to hold up much longer.
25) LEE
You want to leave the motel?
26) MARK
These folks need us, Lee. We could work something out.
27) LEE
We haven't been invited to stay.
28) MARK
[good-natured] Bastard.
29) LEE
We don't know these people.
30) LEE
[teasing] Who says that worked out?
31) MARK
You didn't know ME before you showed up at the base.
32) MARK
Keep telling that to everybody trying to kill us. Maybe they'll go away.
33) LEE
It's safer back at the motel.
34) MARK
With the fence working, this place is like a fortress.
35) MARK
Not many drivers these days, Lee.
36) MARK
We could scrounge up a year's worth of gas, easy.
37) LEE
The fence only lasts as long as the gas does.
38) MARK
We've got enough people.
39) LEE
A fortress needs people to defend it.
281) 
A fortress needs people to defend it.
40) MARK
You're too paranoid, Lee.
41) LEE
Don't get too comfortable here.
42) LEE
What about 'em?
43) LEE
This place is going to fall apart, just like everywhere else.
44) LEE
These folks are just delaying the inevitable.
45) MARK
Well, let's help 'em delay it a bit longer.
46) MARK
Sheesh, Lee. You sound like Kenny.
47) LEE
We've got enough people to take this place by force, if we have to.
48) BANDIT
Come on out!
49) BANDIT
It ain't right, we had a deal!
50) BANDIT
You fucked with us, now we'll take what we want.
51) BANDIT
Show Yourself!!
52) MARK
This one must've knocked it over trying to get through.
53) MARK
Andy said, when this fence is working, the walkers go up like a tree branch on a power line.
54) MARK
He's tangled up in there pretty good. Come on, help me get this thing back in place so we can get Mr. Crispy off of there.
55) MARK
[exertion from lifting] Nggrrhh....
56) LEE
[panicked] What happened?!
288) 
What happened?!
57) MARK
[pickup3]	[in pain] Some asshole shot me! God DAMN!
58) LEE
Can you walk?
289) 
Can you walk?
59) MARK
[pickup3][in pain] Yeah...  But I ain't moving while that maniac is out there!
60) LEE
We gotta get out of here.
290) 
We gotta get out of here.
61) MARK
[pickup3][in pain] If we move, we're dead!
62) LEE
Let's get out of here!
63) MARK
[in pain] Yeah, but  we can't just walk out into the open. We need cover!
336) MARK
[in pain] Yeah, but  we can't just walk out into the open. We need cover!
64) LEE
C'mon, if we can reach the gate, we get through this fence and back to the house.
65) MARK
[pickup3]	[in pain] Aghh!  Shit that hurts!
66) LEE
[exertion from lifting] Nggghh...
67) MARK
[hit by arrow] Gaaaahhh!
68) MARK
[surprised, in pain] What the- ?
69) BANDIT
I told you what would happen, you son of a bitch!
70) MARK
[tense/under fire][in pain] JESUS!!! Who the fuck is that?!
71) LEE
No fuel. Of course.
72) MARK
[pickup3][In pain] Lee! We've gotta do something!
73) MARK
[responding to Lee's silence]["It's almost like things used to be..."][Sad] ...Almost.
74) MARK
[responding to Lee's silence]Well... better here than out with the... you know. [zombies]
75) MARK
If those lights are out that means the fence is off, right?
76) LEE
It'd better be.
77) MARK
There's one.
78) MARK
Eeugh.
79) LEE
Come on, let's push it off.
80) MARK
I see it.
236) LEE
[pickup2] I see it.
81) LEE
There's another one.
235) MARK
[pickup2] There's another one.
82) MARK
Ya never do get used to the smell, do ya?
359) MARK
Ya never do get used to the smell, do ya?
83) LEE
[chuckles] Nope.
358) LEE
[chuckles] Nope.
84) MARK
[continuing/responding to silence]'Cause I find it to be a breath of fresh air.  Literally!
85) MARK
So what do you think, Lee? Should we stick around here?
86) MARK
[awkwardly starting the conversation again] Sooo... what about the brothers?
87) MARK
[responding to Lee's silence]...Oookay....
88) LEE
Thanks.
255) LEE
Thanks.
89) MARK
I dunno.  They seem decent enough. I just want you to know that I've got your back if anything goes down.
90) MARK
Come on, I think I see where they're getting in.
91) MARK
[context: no need to worry about it, it's dead] Lee, it's dead.
92) MARK
[sarcastic]If you're waiting for that guy to help, it ain't gonna happen. [now get over here and help me]Come on.
93) LEE
Get down!
135) MARK
[Urgent/not shouted]Get down!
94) MARK
Fuck!  Now what?!
95) BANDIT
Can't hide forever!
96) BANDIT
You assholes deserve to die!
97) BANDIT
I can do this ALL day!
98) MARK
[as Lee is killed]LEE!!
103) MARK
[as Lee is killed]LEE!!
111) MARK

106) BANDIT
I gotcha now!
107) BANDIT
Shit!
114) LEE
Shit!!!
108) BANDIT
You got lucky that time!
109) BANDIT
Damnit.
110) LEE
[exerting force] Eeenngh...
115) MARK
[pickup3][in pain]You okay?
116) LEE
Yeah... barely.
117) MARK
Holy fuck!  What just happened?!
118) LEE
The fences are on!
119) MARK
Why the hell would he turn the fence on! He knows we're out here!
120) MARK
[pickup3][in pain]Come on, the gate's right there!
121) MARK

125) MARK
[Killed with an arrow 3]
126) LEE
[tense/under fire]Guess the St. John boys pissed somebody off.  Bandits probably.
127) MARK
[nostalgic]It could be just like it used to be.
128) MARK
[nostalgic]It could be just like it used to be.
130) MARK
[nostalgic]It could be just like it used to be.
132) MARK
[Urgent/not shouted] Lee, hurry up!
133) MARK
[Urgent/not shouted]Get out of the open!
134) MARK
[Urgent/not shouted]Lee, get back here!
136) MARK
[Urgent/not shouted]Quickly!  He'll see you!
137) LEE
[pickup1][With mark behind the tractor after its stuck on a still living zombie]Shit.  Now what?
141) MARK
[pickup1] [friendly conversation with Lee while walking the fence line][mild outdoor projection]Hey, maybe we should try to get Larry out here, huh? Let him get some fresh air in those dusty lungs...
142) MARK
[pickup1] [friendly conversation with Lee while walking the fence line][mild outdoor projection][continued]... Maybe then he'll realize you're no danger to this group.
143) MARK
[pickup1] [friendly conversation with Lee while walking the fence line][mild outdoor projection][cont.]... I think even Larry would have trouble being a "racist asshole" out here!
144) MARK
[pickup1] [friendly conversation with Lee while walking the fence line][mild outdoor projection][cont.]... Whatever his problem is with you, I bet he'd forget all about it!
145) LEE
[pickup1][explaining why the tractor stopped] Shit. It's one of the dead we pushed down earlier. I'm gonna have to move it.
146) MARK
[pickup3][in pain][behind the tractor for cover when it stops moving]What happened?
147) MARK
[pickup3][in pain][as the tractor stops again]Another one?  How many of those things did we push down?
148) MARK
[pickup1][looking at the dead zombie they just pushed off the fence]Who do you think he was?
149) LEE
[pickup1][response to Mark asking who the zombie on the fence might have been] It doesn't matter.
150) LEE
[pickup1][response to Mark asking who the zombie on the fence might have been]Maybe a farm hand.  I dunno.  I hope he wasn't like this long before the fence finished him off.
151) MARK
[pickup1][agreeing that it's better to be dead than a zombie] Yeah.
152) MARK
[pickup1][looking at the dead zombie they pushed off the fence] Poor guy.
153) LEE
[pickup1][pressing Mark to keep moving along the fence] Come on, I'm sure there's still a few more.

[pickup2]Glad you decided to stick around here.
178) LEE
[pickup2] Let's hope it's a permanent thing.
269) LEE
[pickup2] Let's hope it's a permanent thing.
179) MARK
[pickup2] Glad we're on the same page about that.
180) MARK
[pickup2] I know you said this place wasn't right for us, but c'mon, LOOK at it!
181) MARK
[pickup2] I know you said we shouldn't trust strangers, but they seem all right. Besides, this place! I mean, C'MON!
182) MARK
[pickup2]Listen, I know you think this place isn't safe for Clementine, but you're being a little overprotective.
183) LEE
[pickup2]Why the hell did you have to tell him I thought he's a racist? As if tensions weren't high enough!
184) LEE
[pickup2]He wouldn't be such a pain in the ass if you weren't telling him we were talking behind  his back all the time.
185) LEE
[pickup2]What were you thinking, telling him what I said about him thinking I'm dangerous?
186) MARK
[pickup2]Sorry man! It just... popped out!
187) MARK
[pickup2]I'm sorry, all right?
188) MARK
[pickup2] I mean, you DID admit it right to his face...
189) 
He's a piece of shit.
190) 
We'll work it out somehow.
193) LEE
[pickup2] We'll work it out somehow.
191) 
I try to be civil at least.
194) LEE
[pickup2] I try to be civil, at least.
192) LEE
[pickup2] That guy's a piece of shit anyway.
195) MARK
[pickup2]He's too busy being cranky to notice.
196) MARK
[pickup2]Well, hopefully he'll calm down once he's out here.
197) MARK
[pickup2] Relax. You're not making things any better riling him up.
198) MARK
[pickup2] Well, maybe a good meal will chill him out a little.
199) MARK
[pickup2]Christ, I can't stop thinking about dinner.
200) 
Focus on the task.
201) 
We'll go ask for more to eat after.
202) 
I'm hungry, too.
203) LEE
[pickup2] If they've got as much food as they say, I think so.
204) LEE
[pickup2] Just try to focus on the task.
205) MARK
[pickup2] Do you think they're gonna be good for it? Dinner for a whole group of people?
206) LEE
[pickup2] We'll go ask for more to eat after this is done.
207) MARK
[pickup2] All right, I can suck it up.
208) LEE
{pickup2} I'm hungry too, Mark.
209) MARK
[pickup2] They knew what they were doing, teasing us with food and then giving us chores!
210) LEE
[pickup2] Having a good meal will be worth it.
211) MARK
[pickup2] Let's just get this done. Maybe Brenda has some more bread in the house.
212) MARK
[pickup2] Once this fence is patched up, this place'll be a fortress! God, can you imagine not having to worry about the walkers anymore?
213) LEE
[pickup2] We've got the people to defend it.
280) 
We've got the people to defend it.
214) MARK
[pickup2] Between us and the dairy guys? No problem!
215) LEE
[pickup2] We still need to be careful. It's still dangerous as hell.
216) MARK
[pickup2] We just keep the kids away from it, nothing to worry about.
217) MARK
[pickup2] True, but it's also dangerous to the walkers.
218) LEE
[pickup2] It's dangerous.
283) 
It's dangerous.
219) MARK
[pickup2] So, what's your take on the brothers? They seem to have this place tied down pretty well.
220) 
What do you mean?
222) 
They've been pretty generous.
223) 
They're delaying the inevitable.
224) 
We can take this place if we have to.
225) LEE
[pickup2] What do you mean by that?
226) LEE
[pickup2] They've been pretty generous so far.
227) MARK
[pickup2] Yeah, definitely. I mean, I know we're not getting something for nothin', but still...
228) MARK
[pickup2] Well, they seem decent enough. I just want you to know that I've got your back if anything goes down.
229) MARK
[pickup2] So... about that guy in the woods... Did we do the right thing? Just leaving him there?
230) LEE
[pickup2][matter-of-fact] There was nothing we could do.
231) LEE
[pickup2][matter-of-fact] We did all we could, Mark.
232) LEE
[pickup2][unsure] I don't know.
233) MARK
[pickup2] It's just been getting to me.
234) LEE
[tense/under fire]No idea!
237) MARK
[pickup2] But I...
238) MARK
[pickup2][just shot though the neck] Uggkkkkk!
239) LEE
[pickup2][just saw Mark get shot through the neck] Oh, fuck!
240) LEE
[pickup2][terrified] What the hell!?
241) MARK
[pickup3][pickup2] We're gonna have to move it. That maniac isn't gonna stop!
242) BANDIT
[pickup2] Where's our food you assholes!?
243) BANDIT
[pickup2] You didn't deliver the goods! Now we're gonna take what's owed!
244) BANDIT
[pickup2] We had an agreement! Now you're fucked!
245) MARK
[pickup2] I can't wait until everyone's out here. Everyone besides Larry...
246) MARK
[pickup2] Look, you said it.
247) MARK
[pickup2] You even admitted it right to him.
248) MARK
[pickup2]You admitted it to him anyway...
249) LEE
[pickup2] It's useless without gas. We might need food, but the St. Johns need gas too.
250) 
It's useless without gas.
251) MARK
[pickup2] I suppose...
252) MARK
[pickup2] Not if we all work together. They're really taking care of this place.
253) MARK
[pickup2][sad, context: You're probably right that this place will fall eventually]Maybe you're right.
254) MARK
And by the sounds of it, you're just counting the hours before it does.
257) MARK
And by the sounds of it, you're just counting the hours before it does.
256) MARK
[pickup2] It's encouraging to see how well they take care of this place.
258) MARK
[pickup2] You said it. I'm really happy we took them up on their offer.
259) MARK
[pickup2] Out here, it's almost like things used to be.
261) MARK
[pickup2] Out here, it's almost like things used to be.
270) MARK
[pickup2] Out here, it's almost like things used to be.
260) MARK
[pickup2] See? I knew you'd change your mind eventually!
262) LEE
[pickup2] I'm not so sure. We don't know anything about this place.
265) LEE
[pickup2] I'm not so sure. We don't know anything about this place.
263) MARK
[pickup2] Oh, come on. You seemed really into the idea back there!
264) LEE
[pickup2] I've been thinking it over, that's all.
266) MARK
[pickup2] I know you're not sold, but I think this place is perfect!
267) MARK
[pickup2] God, can you imagine it? There's more than enough room for us all!
268) MARK
[pickup2] Oh yeah? Changing your tune I see! You didn't seem so gung-ho before!
271) MARK
You're crazy. Everyone else is so excited!
272) MARK
[pickup2] Woulda been nice to get some of those rations. I get hungry too, ya know.
273) MARK
[pickup2] Thanks for the rations earlier. It's not easy eating in front of the kids, but it's all that's keeping me on my feet right now.
276) LEE
[pickup2b][underfire frm the bandits, lee figures out what to do next]I just gotta get to that gate!
277) LEE
{pickup2b}[talking to himself]Maybe I can get this thing moving... use it for cover.
278) LEE
[pickup2b][to himself as the tractor stops against another zombie]Shit.  How many of these things did we knock down?
279) LEE
[pickup2b][having reached the safety of the gate, Lee looks back toward Mark's dead body.]Sorry, Mark.  [then, to himself, getting angry] What the fuck is going on around here?!
282) 
We still need to be careful.
284) 
It doesnt matter.
285) 
Maybe a farm hand.
286) LEE
[pickup2][looking at a dead zombie on the fence]At least it's not one of us.
287) 
At least it's not one of us.
291) BANDIT2
[pickup2] What about our arrangement?!
292) BANDIT3
[calling out orders to other bandits]I see 'em!
293) BANDIT2
[calling out orders to other bandits]Over there!
294) BANDIT3
Did you really think you could fuck with us?
295) BANDIT2
[calling out orders to other bandits]Behind the tractor!
296) BANDIT3
Give us the food!
297) BANDIT2
You assholes!
298) BANDIT3
I already got one of ya!
299) BANDIT2
[calling out orders to other bandits]Get closer!
300) BANDIT3
[calling out orders to other bandits]Try to lure 'em into the open.

Push

303) LEE
[pickup3][casual - Noticing that the dead zombie is pinned to thefencepost] Looks like he's stuck.
305) 
Pull
306) LEE
[pickup3][to himself as he pulls an arrow out of the dead zombie]Disgusting.
307) LEE
[pickup3][looking at a dead zombie pinned to the fencpost with an arrow]Maybe the St. John boys were using this guy for target practice?
309) LEE
[pickup3][looking at the dead zombie on the fence post]We'll have to get this guy off the post before we fix it.
311) 
Chop

317) 
Usar.
318) LEE
[pickup3][looking at a dead zombie pinned to the fencpost with an arrow]I don't know what got him first, the arrow or the fence.  Either way, I hope he was already dead.
319) LEE
[pickup3][shouting into the woods where bandits are trying to shoot him with arrows]Who the fuck are you?!
320) LEE
[pickup3][shouting into the woods where bandits are trying to shoot him with arrows]Stop shooting at us!
321) LEE
[pickup3][shouting into the woods where bandits are trying to shoot him with arrows]We're not your enemy?!
322) LEE
[pickup3][shouting into the woods where bandits are trying to shoot him with arrows]We're NOT the St. Johns!!
323) LEE
[pickup3][shouting into the woods where bandits are trying to shoot him with arrows]STOP SHOOTING!!
324) LEE
[pickup3][shouting into the woods where bandits are trying to shoot him with arrows]We don't know you!!
325) LEE
[pickup3][shouting into the woods where bandits are trying to shoot him with arrows]We don't mean you any harm, God dammit!!
326) LEE
[pickup3][shouting into the woods where bandits are trying to shoot him with arrows]Let's talk this out!!
327) LEE
[pickup3][shouting into the woods where bandits are trying to shoot him with arrows]Show yourselves!
328) LEE
[pickup3][shouting into the woods where bandits are trying to shoot him with arrows]Get out here and face me like a man!
329) LEE
