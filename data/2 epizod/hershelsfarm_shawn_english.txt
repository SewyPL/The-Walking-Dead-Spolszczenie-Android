{SadA} My dad doesn't know how bad it is.
24) LEE
{sadA} No, he doesn't.
25) SHAWN
{FearA} I saw a guy in Atlanta kill a kid. A boy. Just shot him right in the face.

Silence
27) 
Sometimes it's kill or be killed.
28) LEE
{fearA} Damn.

35) SHAWN
{fearA} Like put a gun to that kid's head and pull the trigger? {disgustA} Fuck that, man.
36) SHAWN
{thinkingA} I don't even know. He was either attacking the guy or asking for help.
37) SHAWN
{angryA} You don't see things like that. {normalB} It's not like in the movies.
38) SHAWN
{FearA} He didn't even hesitate. He just turned, put the barrel of the gun right between this kid's eyes {sadB}and pulled the trigger.
39) LEE
{normalD} Oh, uh...
40) SHAWN
{sadA} Did you have to do it?
41) LEE
{thinkingA} Do what?
42) SHAWN
{thinkingB} Yeah. It's not like a rag doll or a puppet without strings. It's heavy.
43) LEE

106) SHAWN
{thinkingA} It's cool, don't worry about it.
53) SHAWN
{thinkingA} I could shoot one, maybe. {sadA} If it were far away.
54) SHAWN
{fearB} Whoa, I couldn't do that.
55) SHAWN
{sadA} I guess. {thinkingA} I don't think I'd sleep good after that.
