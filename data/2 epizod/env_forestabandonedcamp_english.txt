[pickup2] {angryA}I did what nobody else would.
155) LEE
[pickup2] {disgustedB}You destroyed this group, Kenny. There's no coming back from it.
156) LEE
[pickup2] {sadA}Everything's going to be different now.
157) LEE
[pickup2] {normalD}Kenny, you're not a bad man. {sadA}But fuck... What the hell are we going to do now?
158) LEE
[pickup2] {sadA}You're no hero. {angryA}You destroyed TWO lives in that meat locker.
159) KENNY
[pickup2] {disgustA}Well, maybe we should stay out of each others way for a while.
160) LEE
[pickup2] {sadA}I couldn't do it, Ken.
161) KENNY
[pickup2] {angryA}I don't care. You do what you have to do, {disgustA}I'm-a keep doing what needs to be done.
162) KENNY
[pickup2] {sadA}Fine, then. {disgustA}Fine. I saved Duck on the farm and didn't save Shawn. Now I kill someone before it can put your little girl in danger, and {fearA}I'm even more of a monster.

[pickup2] ...Were you guys able to salvage anything good from the dairy?
172) DOUG
[pickup2] It's just a basic camcorder. A Save Lots cheapie. Let me check it out, see if I can get it working.
173) CARLEY
[pickup2] {happyB}Hey, Lee.  There were some batteries in the back.  I thought they might work in your camcorder.
174) JOLENE
[pickup2][crazy, screaming into a self-shot camcorder] JAKE, BART, LINDA and ALL YA'LL FUCKIN' SICKOS FROM THE SAVE-LOTS! THEY CALL YA'LL BANDITS! BUT YOU'RE FUCKING RAPIST MONSTERS--
175) JOLENE
[pickup2][quietly narrating a video from the bushes. like discovery channel. but by a crazy person] Look'ee here. Jake, you don't know about these folk yet do you... because you're too distracted by that stupid farm.

177) LEE
[pickup2] Not really. St. John's took everyting I had before the place got completely overrun with walkers.
178) LEE
[pickup2] It doesn't work.  You have any use for it, Doug?
179) 
We're not like the bandits.

186) CLEMENTINE
[pickup2] What if it's not abandoned? What if it IS someone's?
187) LEE
[pickup2] {angryA}No, Clementine is right. We can't rob from people, even if we don't know if they're around.
188) KENNY
[pickup2] {angryB}What?! Did you get some meal back there the rest of us missed out on?! We HAVE to take this stuff.
189) 
I don't want any part of it.
190) 
We'll survive without it.
197) LEE
[pickup2] {normalC}We'll survive without it.
191) KENNY
[pickup2] {angryC}Suit yourself.
192) KENNY

200) KENNY
[pickup2] {angryB}We're starving!
201) KENNY
[pickup2]{angryB}The rest of us are taking this stuff.
202) KENNY
[pickup2][Kenny is still sore that Lee didnt have is back in the meatlocker, but Lee DID save Katjaa from Brenda]{angryA}I want to thank you for getting Katjaa out of that house, {disgustA}but that doesn't change what happened in the meat locker.
203) 
You're on a tear today, huh.
204) 
We've done enough damage already.
205) LEE
[pickup2]{angryB}We've done enough damage already.
206) KATJAA
[pickup2][taking a box from Kenny]{normalB}Yeah.  I got it.
207) BEN
[pickup2][taking a box from Kenny]{normalB}Enh..
208) KENNY
[pickup2][in the background, Kenny gves out Boxes of stuff]{normalC}Got it?
209) KENNY
[pickup2][in the background, Kenny gives out Boxes of stuff]{normalC}Here...
210) DOUG
[pickup2][spooked by what he saw on the camcorder he just fixed] {normalC}Hey...Lee?  {happyB}You know that camcorder?  I got it working....you might wanna see this.
211) LEE
[pickup2]{happyA}Thanks.
212) LEE

214) DOUG
[pickup2][awarkly hand Clem something to play with] {happyC}Here, Clem.  Want some... uhh.. batteries?
215) LEE
[pickup2]Good timing, Doug.
216) DOUG
[pickup2]Hey, Lee.  I think I fixed this thing.  Just had to press a couple jumpers back in.  It needs some batteries, but it should work.
217) CARLEY
[pickup2] {happyA}Why don't you keep it. Sometimes it helps to have something you can document your thoughts on.
218) LEE
[pickup2] {normalA}Do you want it?
219) CARLEY
[pickup2] {sadA}Katjaa managed to grab this while he was in the house.  She said it was with your stuff.
220) LEE
[pickup2] {sadA}Yeah.  I found it while I was looking for the people who shot Mark.
221) KATJAA
[pickup2][remembering]Oh!  I was able to grab a couple of your things back while Brenda wasn't looking...
225) DOUG
Let me check it out, see if I can get it working.
226) DOUG
[pickup2] It's just a basic camcorder. A Save Lots cheapie.
227) LEE
I think it's broken but, Danny seemed pretty interested in it until he found that out.
228) LEE
You have any use for it, Doug?
229) CARLEY
[pickup3][Lee teasing her about her lack of bettry skills]You're not gonna let me live that down, are you?
230) LEE
[pickup3][sarcastic, but still tired from the LONG day] Batteries huh? Think you can handle those?
231) CARLEY
[pickup3][horrified by what she sees on the video tape]  Oh, god.  Lee.  You're gonna want to see this...
232) CARLEY
[pickup3][handing Lee some batteries]Hey. There were some batteries in one of those boxes.  I thought they might work in your camcorder.
233) KENNY
[pickup3][pissed, but keeping it between Lee & Kenny]Look, I don't know where you think we stand right now, so let me make it perfectly clear.
234) KENNY
[pickup3][laying it down for Lee]Once we get back to the motor inn, I'm getting that RV running and me and my family are taking off... without you and that girl, got it?
235) LEE
[pickup3][Stern & defensive]You MURDERED Larry.
236) LEE
[pickup3]Yeah, I know.  I've got your back, we made the right choice, but what the hell happens now?
237) LEE
[pickup3][having kenny's back]It'll be fine.  Lilly will get over it.  She has to. You're a better leader for us anyway.
238) KENNY
[pickup3][confiding in Lee about the RV]Listen, that RV back at the motor inn is just about ready to roll.  I want you to come with us.  I mean it.
239) KENNY
[pickup3][changing his mind about not bringing Lee in the RV] Listen, that RV back at the motor in is just about ready.  I've changed my mind. I want you to come with us when we leave.
240) LEE
[pickup3][accepting the ride invitation] Okay, yeah.
241) LEE
[pickup3]Yeah?
242) KENNY
[pickup3][explaining why he changed his mind about Lee] Hell yeah.  We're a team, man.  Me and you!  By taking out Larry before he turned, you saved all of us in that meat locker!  And that saved my family too.  Yeah, I'd say you earned it!
243) KENNY
[pickup3]I don't care what I said to you before...
244) LEE
[pickup3]I saved your wife and kid!
245) KENNY
[pickup3]You are a sad excuse for a man.  You constantly put me and my family last.
246) KENNY
[pickup3]No, I saved them!  By making sure Larry didn't kill US!
247) KENNY
Baby, you've gotta see this!
248) KENNY
{happyC}There is a shit load of food and supplies back here!
249) KENNY
[pickup3][looting the car]{happyC}Okay, what have we got in here?

252) DOUG
[pickup3][looting the car]Any electronics?  Radios? Batteries?
253) CARLEY
[pickup3][looting the car]{thinkingA}See if there's any water...
254) LEE
[pickup3][follows 310423699]I never thought a laser pointer would be the thing that saved our lives.
258) LEE
[pickup3][follows 310423800]If you hadn't taken that shot at Andy, we might not have gotten out of there.
259) CLEMENTINE
[pickup3] Lee... Did you have to kill those men?
260) 
Yes.  They were bad.
261) 
I'm sorry you saw that.
262) 
I shouldn't have done that
263) CLEMENTINE
[pickup3]... Yes.  I think so.
264) LEE
[pickup3]Yes.  They were bad men, Clementine.  They killed Mark and were going to kill all of us.  They had to be stopped. Understand?
265) LEE
[pickup3][feeing a bit guilty]I... I'm sorry you had to see that.   But I only did it to protect us.
266) CLEMENTINE
[pickup3]Because they tried to hurt us?
267) LEE
[pickup3]Yes.
268) LEE
[pickup3]I.. I wasnt thinking.  I was anrgy, and I was scared. But I did the wrong thing.  You should never kill somebody unless you absolutely have to, okay?
269) CLEMENTINE
[pickup3]Why did you?
270) LEE
[pickup3][feeling guilty]I... I shouldn't have done that.  They were very bad men, Clementine, but that doesn't mean I had to kill them.
272) CLEMENTINE
[pickup3][sad that people are dead, but]...I'm glad WE'RE still alive.
273) CLEMENTINE
[pickup3]Lee... Are those bad people dead?
274) 
Yes.  Walkers probably got em.
275) 
We didn't kill them, so I don't know.
276) 
No, they are alive and suffering.
277) LEE
[pickup3]Yes.  Walkers probably got 'em.  They were very bad people and were punished for it.
278) LEE
[pickup3]We didn't kill them, so I don't know.  They might have been able to get away from the walkers, but I'm sure they wont be coming after us.
279) CLEMENTINE
[pickup3]That's good.
280) LEE
[pickup3]No, they are alive and suffering.  They were very bad people, but if they die, it won't be because I killed them.
281) CLEMENTINE
[pickup3][sad]It's okay.  We don't have to talk about it.
282) LILLY
[pickup3][still fairly emotionless] You know, Dad told me about you... what you did to the senator... I didn't think you had it in you, but after tonight...
283) LILLY
[pickup3]...I just hope you're doing it for the right reasons.
284) LILLY
[pickup3]You know, my Dad told me about you... about what happened with the senator...
285) LEE
[pickup3] Lilly I-
286) LILLY
[pickup3]Look, I don't care what happened in your past.  Tonight I saw what kind of man you are.  You could have killed every one of them, but you didn't.  I think that says a lot.
287) LEE
[pickup2] I stopped her. This fucking world, now. It's hiding just, unspeakable shit at every turn.

[pickup2][quietly narrating a video from the bushes. like discovery channel. but by a crazy person] Regarde, Jake. Tu ne les connais pas encore, et pourtant� Parce que tu es trop distrait par cette stupide ferme.
291) JOLENE
[pickup2][quietly narrating a video from the bushes. like discovery channel. but by a crazy person] Oh, ma ch�rie. Regarde-toi. Regarde. Tu as besoin d'une maman, ma ch�rie. On ne va pas laisser ces bandits te faire du mal.
