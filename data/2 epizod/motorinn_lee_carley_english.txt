[pickup 3] {happyA}Have an apple, Carley.
3) CARLEY
[pickup 2] {happyA}God, I used to eat an apple every morning with some granola and six almonds, and {thinkingA}that wasn't enough then. {happyA}But you know what? Yes.
7) LEE
[pickup 2] [giving some junk food]{normalC}Here.
8) LEE
[pickup 2] {fearA}What should we do about the kid?
40) 
What should we do about the kid?
9) LEE
[pickup 2] {sadA}Sorry I ran out before I could give you any food.
10) CARLEY
[pickup 2]{normalB}Hey, don't feel bad. {disgustA}I'd almost rather starve than eat most of that stuff. Besides, {happyA}you've done plenty for me already.
11) LEE
[pickup2][sean edit] {thinkingA}Sleeping any better?
12) LEE
[pickup2] [sean edit] {fearA}Drugstore? [as in "still? you still having nightmares about what happened at the drugstore?]
13) CARLEY
[pickup2][sean edit] {sadA}No. I know we should be grateful for beds, but, no. {sadB}I'm not.
14) CARLEY
[pickup2][sean edit] {sadB}Yeah.
15) CARLEY
[pickup2]{thinkingA}If it were up to me, I'd let him stay for a while, see if he proves to be an asset.  {angryA}But that's up to Lilly.  {thinkingA}And with her in charge of the food, I don't want to get on her bad side.
16) 
Sleeping any better?
17) CARLEY
{disgustA}I want you to have this, okay? In case you or Clementine starts feeling weak.
18) CARLEY
{thinkingA}You look like crap, Lee. When was the last time you ate?
19) LEE
[Don't worry about me]{sadA}I'm okay.
20) LEE
{sadA}You don't owe me anything, Carley.

23) CARLEY
[pickup3][Thanking Lee for saving him 3 months ago]I know things happened so fast back at the drugstore... And maybe saving me was more of a reaction than a choice, but...
24) CARLEY
[pickup3][Thanking Lee for saving him 3 months ago]Look, you said you saved me because you thought I needed help.  Well, this is me thinking you and Clementine might need help, too.
25) CARLEY
[pickup3][Thanking Lee for saving him 3 months ago]I know you said you wanted to save both me and Doug... but you chose me first.  And I - I just...
26) CARLEY
[pickup3][Thanking Lee for saving him 3 months ago]I know I said it didn't matter why you saved me instead of Doug, but...
27) CARLEY
[pickup3][sean edit] Me? How about you?
28) LEE
Want something to eat?
52) LEE
Want something to eat?
29) 
I'm out of food
30) 
Want some food? [Give Food]
31) LEE
[pickup3][knowing there is only one more piece of food left]Hm.  Maybe I should keep this for myself?
32) LEE
[pickup3][to himself - depressed, having only 1 piece of food left]One more piece of food to give out, then it's all gone for today.
34) LEE
[pickup3][to himself - keeping the last bit of food for himself]I need to keep up my strength, too.
36) LEE
[pickup3][to himself - choosing to save the food for someone else]Nah.  Some of these people have gone longer than me without food.  They're the ones that need it.
37) LEE
[pickup3]Lilly has me handing out the food.
38) CARLEY
[pickup3]Ugh.  That can't be an easy job.
39) LEE
[pickup3] It's not.  I won't be able to feed everyone.  What should I do?
41) 
I'm giving out food, what should I do?
42) LEE
[pickup3]Thanks Carley.
43) LEE
[pickup3]What about you?  You need food too.
44) CARLEY
[pickup3]We ALL need food.  I can't tell you what to do. But whatever happens, I know you'll be trying to do the right thing.
45) CARLEY
[pickup3]Well, if you wanted to get in good with Lilly, I'd make sure Larry gets some food, even though the guy can be a real dick sometimes.
46) CARLEY
[pickup3]On the other hand, giving that food to Kenny and his family might make him remember you if he decides to take off in that RV one day.
48) LEE
Back in a bit.
49) LEE
Ya regreso.
50) LEE
I'll be back in a bit.
51) LEE
I'll be back in a bit.
