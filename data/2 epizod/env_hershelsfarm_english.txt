I wouldn't worry too much.
73) LEE
{normalA} Your son's right. {angryA} You're going to want to fortify this place.
74) LEE
{thinkingA} I wouldn't worry too much.  We're pretty far from the city, it seems like that's where it's the worst.
75) SHAWN
{angryA} Dad, I'm serious. {sadA} Lee, come on, tell him what you saw out there, man.

Do you uh� think this thing will keep them out?
219) SHAWN
Not yet; I'm planning on coming back through on a "fortification pass" if you will. We'll lock this place up good.

{sadB}{body-A} I panicked.
227) LEE
{sadA}{body-A} I was worried about the boy.
228) LEE
{sadB}{body-A} I thought I could help them both.
229) 
I'm sorry.
230) 
I panicked.
231) 
I was worried about the little boy.

{angryC} But you weren't worried about THAT.
238) HERSHEL
{disgustA} You thought wrong. {fearA} And now...
239) HERSHEL
{disgustA} You've got nothing to say to him, do you?
240) HERSHEL
You've got nothing to say to that???
241) HERSHEL
{fearA} You tried to help him, {angryC} but this piece of shit let him die.
243) 
It's my fault.
244) 
It's nobody's fault.
245) 
It's Kenny's fault.
246) LEE

251) HERSHEL
{sadB} You don't need to say anything. {angryA}You tried.
536) HERSHEL
{sadB} You don't need to say anything. {angryA}You tried.
252) HERSHEL
{disgustA} If your girl is ever trapped you better hope you get stronger or your {angryA}friends aren't cowards.
253) HERSHEL
{angryC} The hell I can't. You watch your back. {disgustA}Wait until it's your daughter and you need his help.
254) HERSHEL
{angryB} And that's why I'll wish you were dead for the rest of my life.

415) HERSHEL
[pickup1] We'll clean it, re-dress it and you'll be fine.
416) HERSHEL
[pickup1] If your leg gets hot or the swelling doesn't go down; you're probably dealing with an infection.
417) HERSHEL
[pickup1] We'll probably just have to shoot you.
418) LEE
[pickup1] What do we do then?
419) HERSHEL
[pickup1] Where were you headed? Before the car accident?
