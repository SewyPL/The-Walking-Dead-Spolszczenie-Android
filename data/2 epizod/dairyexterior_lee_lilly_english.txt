1) LILLY
[pickup2] Lee, oh my god, I'm so sorry about Mark. Are you okay?
2) LEE
[pickup2]As good as I can be, I guess.
3) LILLY
[pickup2]{sadA}Lee, oh my god, I'm so glad you two didn't get killed out there. Do you think Mark will be okay?
4) LEE
[pickup2]{sadA}Wish I knew. {normalA}But I think he's in good hands now.
5) LILLY
[pickup2] [sighs, frustrated]{thinkingA}How {angryA}could you all bring us to this place?
6) LEE
[pickup2]{thinkingA}I take it you and Kenny didn't exactly make up on the way here.
7) LILLY
[pickup2]It's just... this really sucks, you know?
8) LEE
[pickup2]We're just going to have to do our best.
9) LEE
[pickup2] Are YOU okay, Lilly?
10) LILLY
[pickup2] It's just hard to see anyone from our group not make it. I keep hoping we're going to all come out of this thing alive.
11) LILLY
[pickup2] I really do appreciate you asking. It's just...
12) LEE
[pickup2]It seemed like you and Mark were getting pretty close, huh?
13) LEE
[pickup2] I know. And maybe we will.
14) LILLY
[pickup2] Mark is... or was... a decent guy. It's just hard losing anybody in the group, you know? Like I keep hoping we're all going to somehow come out of this together.
15) LARRY
[pickup2]{normalA}He'll be fine. {happyA}I've seen guys go through worse.
16) LILLY
[pickup2]{normalA}Yeah? It's not too bad?
17) LILLY
[pickup2] [emotional]Oh God... poor Mark.
18) LEE
[pickup2][sad]Mark getting shot like he did... that was pretty fucked up.
19) LILLY
[pickup2]{thinkingA}I tried seeing things from his point of view, having a wife and kid and everything. {angryA} But gambling with your family's life is pretty stupid, if you ask me.
20) LEE
[pickup2] {normalA}How do you feel about leaving the motor inn?
126) 
How do you feel about leaving the motor inn?
21) LILLY
[pickup2][cold] If we hadn't, Mark would be alive.
22) LILLY
[pickup2] [stern]{angrya}Ugh, If we'd just stayed where we were,{thinkingA}then Mark wouldn't have ended up with an arrow in his shoulder.
23) LEE
[pickup2]{normalA}Think our little arrangement with them was a good idea?
24) LARRY
[pickup2]{angryA}A little late to be asking that question now, don't ya think?
25) LILLY
[pickup2]Let's just wait for dinner, load up as much food as they're willing to give, and hit the road.
26) LILLY
[pickup2]{thinkingA}Let's just wait for dinner, and then if Mark is feeling up to it, we leave. I don't want to push our luck here.
27) LEE
[pickup2] {thinkingA} I'm going to go check things out.
28) LILLY
[pickup2] Lee! What happened at the camp? Did you find any more of those guys that killed Mark?!
29) LILLY
[pickup2] {normalA} Lee! {sadA}What happened at the camp? Did you find any more of those guys that hurt Mark?
30) LEE
[pickup2] {thinkingA} Nothing happened.
131) 
Nothing happened.
31) LILLY
[pickup2]{thinkingA}Really? nothing at all?
32) LEE
[pickup2] {normalA}We found a tent and some boxes. {sadA}Nothing really that useful.
33) LILLY
[pickup2] [sighs] {fearA}Seriously? {angryA}No food?
34) LEE
[pickup2] {sadA}We found a woman in the woods. {normalA}She was talking all crazy with a crossbow pointed right at my head... {sadB}so I had to kill her.
.
35) LEE
[pickup2] {normalA}That's what I said.
36) LARRY
[pickup2] {surprisedA}Jesus Christ. {angryA}Did you at least find some goddamn food?
37) LILLY
[pickup2] {sadA}I don't like this, Lee.{angryA} I still say we should go back to the Motor Inn where we at least know what to expect.
38) LILLY
[pickup2] {fearB}Holy shit. {sadA}Was she one of those bandits?
39) LEE
[pickup2] {thinkingA}I don't know. {normalA}I think she was trying to tell me something, {sadA}but then he just went off.
40) LEE
[pickup2] {sadA}We found a woman in the woods.{normalA} She was talking all crazy and had a crossbow... {sadb}so Danny killed her.
41) LILLY
[pickup2] [frustrated]{angryB}God dammit, Lee, stop trying to keep us out of the loop. {angryA}Coming here was a mistake, I know that. {angryb}But keeping things to yourself isn't exactly going to help the situation.
42) LEE
[pickup2]{THinkingA}Do you get the feeling something's going on here?
128) 
Do you get the feeling something's going on here?
43) LILLY
[pickup2] {angryA}What's going on, Lee?{sadA} Did something happen?
44) 
There's something odd with the barn.
45) 
Kenny thinks they're hiding something.
46) 
Everything is fine.
47) LEE
[pickup2] {thinkingA}There may be something going on with that barn.
48) LILLY
[pickup2]{angryA}If you want to go in there and start rooting through other people's shit, then get to it. {normalA}But if it's up to me, we should just take our food and go.
49) LEE
[pickup2] {angryA}And what exactly do think I'm supposed to do about it?
50) LEE
[pickup2] {thinkingA}Kenny thinks they're hiding something.{normalA} I'm not sure what exactly, but we're starting to get a feeling about this place.
51) LILLY
[pickup2] {angryA}Look, after what happened to Mark and finding that crazy woman at the campsite, I think it's obvious that we need to get the hell out of here. {fearA}And soon.
52) LILLY
[pickup2] {angrya}Look, after what happened to Mark and that crazy woman at the campsite trying to tell you something, I think it's obvious that we need to get the hell out of here. {fearA}And soon.
53) LEE
[pickup2] {normalA}It's nothing. Everything is fine.
54) LARRY
[pickup2] {disgustA} Bullshit.
55) LILLY
[pickup2] {angryA}You're keeping something to yourself, Lee. And by the time you come clean, it's gonna be too late. We need to start thinking about getting the hell out of here.
56) LEE
[pickup2] {thinkingA}After what Kenny told me, I'm starting to think they may be hiding something.
57) LEE
[pickup2]{normalA} Hey.
58) LILLY
[pickup2] {thinkingA} These backwoods people always give me the creeps.
59) LILLY
[pickup2] {normalA}I'm telling you, Lee. The longer we stay here, {angryA}the more trouble we're getting ourselves into.
60) LARRY
[pickup2] {happya}It's a welcome change of scenery.
61) LILLY
[pickup2]{angryA}Dad's right.
62) LILLY
[pickup2]{angryA}You two are just asking for trouble. {thinkingA}But if you insist on wandering around, {sadA}I'd be careful, Lee.
63) LARRY
[pickup2]{angryA}Yeah, and we don't need you pokin' your nose where it don't belong and getting us thrown out on our asses.
64) LILLY
[pickup2]{normalA}Just don't get too nosy. These kinds of people are usually pretty protective of their privacy.
65) LILLY
[pickup2] {sadA} Watch yourself, Lee.
66) LILLY
[pickup2] Whatever you do, just be careful.
67) LILLY
[pickup2] {angrya} I knew it. It was a mistake coming here.
68) LARRY
[pickup2] {angrya}Jesus.
69) LEE
[pickup2]{sadA}It's... nothing. {normalD}Don't worry about it. {thinkingA}Paranoia's just gettin' to me a little bit.
70) LILLY
[pickup2]{thinkingA} What makes you say that? {angrya}What exactly happened at the camp?
71) LEE
[pickup2]I mean, it really seemed like that woman was about to tell me something about this place before Danny shot her.
72) LILLY
[pickup2] {sadA} I know what you mean.
73) LILLY
[pickup2] No, I'm with Lee on this. There's something not right about this place.
74) LEE
[pickup2] {sadA}No. Nothing
75) LARRY
[pickup2]You just told us you killed a woman, for Christ's sake. Yeah, I'd definitely say there's a lot going on.
76) LEE
[pickup2] So Larry, it looks like you're getting along with Brenda pretty well.
77) LARRY
[pickup2] You know, for a nice change of pace, how about you try minding your own fucking business?
78) LEE
[pickup2] {thinkingA}What were you and Kenny arguing about when I came back from the camp?
79) LILLY
[pickup2]{angryA}He's losing it, Lee. {thinkingA}He comes over and starts talking about searching the barn and that these people are hiding something--
80) LARRY
[pickup2]{angrya}But you told him to mind his own goddamn business, right? We are guests here, and we don't need to be overstaying our welcome more than we already are.
81) LILLY
[pickup2]{thinkingA}The way I see it, we need to just skip the dinner and get our food to go. {angryA} But I'm starting to think your {angryb}friend {angryA}over there has another agenda.
82) LEE
[pickup2]I don't know, maybe we SHOULD go have a look in that barn.
83) LARRY
[pickup2] Yeah, we don't wanna fuck this whole thing up.
84) LARRY
[pickup2] Come on now, we don't wanna be rude.
85) LILLY
[pickup2]{angrya}If you ask me, we should just get our dinner and leave.
86) LARRY
[pickup2]{sadA}Now, now, let's not be hasty.
87) 
I take it you and Kenny haven't made up.
88) 
What were you and Kenny arguing over?
89) 
I shot a woman.
90) 
Danny shot someone.
91) 
About your dad...
92) LILLY
[pickup3][casual - responsind to Lee asking to talk in private] {normalA}Okay.
123) LILLY
[pickup3][casual - responsind to Lee asking to talk in private] Okay.
125) LILLY
[pickup3][casual - responsind to Lee asking to talk in private] Okay.
93) LEE
[pickup3][wanting to talk to lilly privately about Larry, but he's nearby] {thinkingA}Hey, ah, {normalA}can I talk to you in private for a second?
94) LILLY
[pickup2]Yeah, well, don't expect that to change.  That's just how he is.
120) LILLY
[pickup2]Yeah, well, don't expect that to change.  That's just how he is.
95) LEE
[pickup2]It's been three months, your dad still treats me like I'm some kind of asshole.
121) LEE
[pickup2]It's been three months, your dad still treats me like I'm some kind of asshole.
96) 
So he's the asshole.
97) LEE
[pickup2]So HE'S the asshole.
98) 
Does he treat you like that too?
99) LEE
[pickup2]Does he treat you like that too?
100) 
How do you put up with him?
101) LEE
[pickup2]How do you put up with him?
102) LILLY
{angryA}All he's got left in the world is me.  {sadA}And that goes both ways.  {disgustA}So, yeah, he's probably gonna keep treating you like crap, but that's just because he still has one thing left to care about.
103) LILLY
{angryA}Look. My dad can be an ass sometimes, I know that.  {normalB}But he's not a bad guy.  He just... {sadA}He's got a lot of pain.
104) LILLY
{sadA}He's been through so much.  And lost... {sadB}pretty much everything.  {normalB}And it's hardened him, ya know?  {thinkingA}Yeah, he's bitter and hateful, but that's all just to protect himself. And me.
105) LILLY
{angryA}So don't judge him.  And don't judge me for sticking by him.  {sadA}He's my dad, and I love him.
106) LILLY
[pickup3][follows:310583317 ]{angryA}Lee, I know you Kenny are friends, {normalA}but you recognize that he's not the right person to lead this group, {sadA}don't you?
107) LILLY
[pickup3]{happyA}Hey, thanks for backing me up this morning at the motel.  {thinkingA}I know I came down on you guys pretty hard, {normalA}but you do agree with the way I'm running things, right?
108) 
You're a good leader.
109) 
Kenny believes there is still hope.
110) 
I don't know.
111) LEE
[pickup3]{happyA}You're a good leader, Lilly. {sadA}Kenny's too emotional, {normalA}but his intentions in the right place.  {thinkingA}Still, it'd be best for all of us if you two could try to work together once in a while.
112) LEE
[pickup3]{normalA}Kenny believes there is still hope.  {sadA}Maybe that's what we need right now.
113) LILLY
[pickup3]Well, hope doesn't do any good if we're all dead.  I'm focused on keeping us alive.
114) LEE
[pickup3]{sadA}I don't know, Lilly.  {normalA}Both you and Kenny have been very important to keeping the group together.
115) LILLY
[pickup3]{thinkingA}Yeah, well, if I don't keep us alive, {angryA}there won't BE a group to keep together.
116) LILLY
[pickup3][responding to lees silence - pleased]{normalA}You don't have to say anything.  {happya}You gave yourself away when you backed me up in front of Kenny, so thanks.
117) LILLY
[pickup3][responding to lees silence - disapointed]{sadA}You don't have to say anything. {angryA}Your actions at the motel pretty much say it all.
118) LILLY
[pickup3]{angryA}And not giving my dad food... That was cold.
119) LILLY
[pickup3]{angryA}And not giving my dad food... That was cold.
122) LEE
[pickup3][wanting to talk to lilly privately about Larry, but he's nearby] Oye, �puedo hablar contigo en privado un segundo?
124) LEE
[pickup3][wanting to talk to lilly privately about Larry, but he's nearby] Oye, �puedo hablar contigo en privado un segundo?
127) 
Do you think this was a good idea?
129) 
I'm starting to think they may be hiding something.
130) 
We found a tent.
