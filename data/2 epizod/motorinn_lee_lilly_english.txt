1) LILLY
{normalB}If the hunting trips nearby don't work, we'll just have to head farther out.
2) LILLY
{angryB}But this is a good spot.  {normalB}We're protected, we're close to the drug store, {thinkingA}we have a routine now and it's working.
3) LILLY
{angryA}God, not you too.  I know Kenny wants to leave.  I think that's why he's so eager to get the RV working.
4) LILLY
[pickup2]Yeah, well, don't expect that to change.  That's just how he is.
5) LEE
[pickup2]It's been three months, your dad still treats me like I'm some kind of asshole.
6) LEE
[pickup2]So HE'S the asshole.
7) LEE
[pickup2]Does he treat you like that too?
8) LEE
[pickup2]How do you put up with him?
9) LILLY
{angryA}All he's got left in the world is me.  {sadA}And that goes both ways.  {disgustA}So, yeah, he's probably gonna keep treating you like crap, but that's just because he still has one thing left to care about.
10) LILLY
{angryA}Look. My dad can be an ass sometimes, I know that.  {normalB}But he's not a bad guy.  He just... {sadA}He's got a lot of pain.
11) LILLY
{sadA}He's been through so much.  And lost... {sadB}pretty much everything.  {normalB}And it's hardened him, ya know?  {thinkingA}Yeah, he's bitter and hateful, but that's all just to protect himself. And me.
12) LILLY
{angryA}So don't judge him.  And don't judge me for sticking by him.  {sadA}He's my dad, and I love him.

[pickup2][responding to silence, annoyed, flat] Whatever.

[pickup2]The arguing.  It's getting pretty out of hand.  You know, people notice that.
40) LILLY
[pickup2][annoyed]Look, I'm working my ASS off to make sure we have a good set up here and Kenny just doesn't appreciate that.
41) LEE
[pickup2]But there is no food.  You know that better than anyone.
