1) LEE
[worried] Kenny?
10) LEE
Kenny?
95) LEE
{fearA}Kenny?
141) LEE
Kenny!
179) LEE
{fearA}Kenny?
2) LEE
Kenny? What's wrong?
3) KENNY
I can do it. I can. Just give me a minute.
4) KENNY
I can do this.
5) LEE
Oh my God.
98) LEE
[pickup]{sadB}Oh my God.
182) LEE
[pickup]{sadB}Oh my God.
6) KENNY
Kinda looks like Duck, don�t he?
7) LEE
Kenny, we don�t have a minute.
8) KENNY
[muttering, under his breath] I can...
9) KENNY
[muttering, under his breath] I can do this. I... I can do it.
11) LEE
[softly]Come on, man.
12) 
What's wrong with you?!
13) LEE
I'll take care of it.
101) LEE
{sadB}I'll take care of it.
103) LEE
{sadB}I'll take care of it.
105) LEE
{sadB}I'll take care of it.
185) 
I'll take care of it.
14) LEE
What the hell do you think happened?
15) LEE
You would have done the same for me. Someone in the group needs help, one of the others steps in. That�s how we stay alive. That�s the only way we stay alive.
16) KENNY
Really? You really have to ask that? What the hell�s wrong with YOU?
17) LEE
Did you? Because you looked like a damn deer in headlights to me. Snap out of it, Kenny! The hell�s wrong with you?
18) LEE
I get what you�re going through. But when the time comes to step up and act, you can�t let that shit get in your head. You hesitate, you�re gonna wind up dead. Or worse.
19) KENNY
Go back downstairs, Ben. We�re done here.
20) BEN
Uh... just wanted to check if you guys were okay.
21) KENNY
[beginning to calm down]Mind must be playing tricks on me. He really did remind me of Duck.
22) LEE
Yeah. Makes me think what might�ve happened to Clem if I hadn�t found her when I did.
23) KENNY
I guess he holed up here, scared to come down. Ran out of food.
24) KENNY
[becoming emotional] We can�t just leave him like this. Duck never got a proper burial. I�ll be damned if this kid doesn�t. He deserves better.
25) 
I was trying to help.
26) LEE
�.No.
27) LEE
I�m sorry, man. I just... I know what you�re going through. Figured it�d be easier if I spared you the grief.
28) KENNY
Then how about you shut the fuck up and leave me be?
29) 
Somebody had to do it.
30) LEE
Somebody had to do it, Kenny. Didn�t look like it was gonna be you.
31) KENNY
[confrontational] I had it. In my own damn time. You think taking an axe to that dead boy was gonna be easy for me? Especially after what I had to do to my own son?
32) LEE
I  know what you're going through. But this world we�re in now, it don�t give a shit. It ain�t gonna give us an inch, no matter how much we might need it to. You let your emotions get in the way next time we�re in a situation, we�re gonna lose you too. And this group can�t afford that.
33) KENNY
Great. That�s just great. You can stomp the kid�s brains out but you can�t tell me why?
34) KENNY
I had it under control until you decided to take over. Why�s it always got to be about you? You think you�re the hero of this story? Because I got news for you. You ain�t.
35) LEE
[rising urgency] Kenny. Now. Now, dammit!
36) LEE
Nobody could have done more than you did to take care of them. I saw that for myself.
37) LEE
It�s okay, man. Let it out. You did what you had to. You did good.
38) KENNY
[distraught] Couldn�t even protect my own son, my own family...
39) LEE
Kenny. It�s all right. It�s done.
40) LEE
Kenny. Come on man, that's enough.
41) KENNY
[like a battle cry] Aaaaaaargh!
42) KENNY
[exertion sounds as he tries to pull out the axe]
43) LEE
Yeah. Just come downstairs when you're ready.
44) KENNY
[emotionally destroyed]You sure?
45) KENNY
[sobbing] Oh God... Duck...
46) 
Kill
47) 
Command
48) KENNY
What the fuck? I told you I was gonna take care of it!
49) KENNY
[horrified] Jesus, Lee!
50) LEE
[softly encouraging]Go on, Kenny. Do it.
51) LEE
Well after what happened with Duck--
52) KENNY
[confrontational]I just put a bullet in my kid's brain yesterday, for christ's sake!
53) KENNY
[confrontational] Just because I ain't cold enough to put a bullet in my own son's head doesn't mean I can't take care of things now. I just needed one god damned moment.
54) KENNY
[confrontational]That was my son, Lee. I may not be cold enough to put a bullet in my own kid's brain, but that doesn't mean I'm useless.
55) KENNY
Fuck you, Lee. You have no idea what I�m going through. And you sure as shit don�t know anything about grief. Can you even imagine how you�d feel if what happened to Duck had happened to Clem instead?
56) KENNY
[confrontational] Can you imagine having to put a bullet in her head?
57) KENNY
[confrontational] Can you imagine just leaving her there as one of those things?
58) KENNY
[confrontational] Can you imagine just leaving her there as one of those things?
59) KENNY
[confrontational] You think taxing an axe to that dead boy was gonna be easy for me? Especially after what I had to do to my own son?
60) KENNY
[confrontational] Just because I ain't cold enough to put a bullet in my own son's head doesn't mean I can't take care of things now.
61) KENNY
[distraught] And when it came time to do what was right for my son... I just couldn't.
62) KENNY
[distraught] And in the end, I had a put a bullet in my own son's head.
63) 
What's wrong?
64) 
Ben said you were in trouble.
65) 
Need any help?
66) KENNY
Kenny? Ben's worried about you, man. Did you--[trailing off]
67) LEE
Hey, do you need any help up here?
68) 
This is how we stay alive.
69) 
Get over it.
72) 
What happened to him?
73) 
Reminds me of Clementine.
74) 
Looks like he starved to death.
75) 
It's alright, Kenny.
76) 
Enough.
77) 
God damn,
78) LEE
God damn, Kenny.
79) 
You can't blame yourself.
80) LEE
Nobody could have done more than you did to take care of them. I saw that for myself. You can't blame yourself. All the shit that's happened... you just can't.
