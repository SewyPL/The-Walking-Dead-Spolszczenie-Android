3) CHRISTA
{WorriedA} Lee? What�s going on?
4) LEE
[shouting, aggressive] {AngryB} You stay the hell away from us, you hear?
5) 
Nothing, just a stray dog.
6) 
Someone was watching us.
7) 
I thought I saw something.
8) 
Silence
94) 
Silence
9) BEN
{AngryA} Didn�t sound like nothing. {ThinkingA}What was all that shouting about?
10) LEE
{NormalC} Nothing.
11) LEE
Just a stray dog sniffing around the gate, I shooed it away. {NormalB} Go on back in, I�m almost done here.
12) CHRISTA
[skeptical] {ThinkingA} Sounded like a lot to say, {AngryA} to a dog.
13) LEE
{NormalC} I saw someone standing there by the fence. {AngryA} Watching us.
14) BEN
{FearB} A walker?
15) LEE
{ThinkingA} No, too fast. {AngryB} Took off like a bat out of hell when I spotted him.
16) CHRISTA
{ThinkingA} Was it a man or a woman?
17) LEE
{ThinkingA} Didn�t get a good enough look.
18) BEN
{FearA} What does it matter?
19) CHRISTA
{AngryA} I�m wondering if it�s the same guy who�s been following us. {NormalB} The guy on the radio.
20) LEE
{NormalD} I thought I saw something outside the fence.
21) CHRISTA
{ThinkingA} Something? {AngryA}Or someone?
22) LEE
{ThinkingA} Didn�t get a good enough look. {NormalB} The way they moved though, {NormalC}too fast to be a walker.
23) CHRISTA
{FearA} Could it have been the guy that�s been following us? The voice on the radio?
24) LEE
{ThinkingA} I don't know, they didn't say anything. Just stood there, {ThinkingB} watching. {AngryA}Creepy as hell.
25) CHRISTA
{FearA} What, Lee? {AngryA} What the hell were you shouting at?
26) BEN
{FearA} Lee?
27) KENNY
[still emotional, trying to act strong]{ThinkingA} What�s all the ruckus?
28) KENNY
{AngryA} Well he�d better get ready. {NormalC} Because I�m going down to River Street right now to {AngryB} find a boat, and as soon as she�s ready to go {AngryA} we�re moving out.
29) CHRISTA
[skeptical] {AngryA} Apparently Lee�s started having conversations with dogs. {ThinkingA} Should we be concerned?
30) LEE
[covering his lie]Just a stray sniffing around outside, it�s nothing.
31) BEN
{NormalC} Whatever it was, sure looks like it had you spooked.
163) BEN
{NormalC} Whatever it was, sure looks like it had you spooked.
32) CHRISTA
{SadA} I don�t know if Omid�s well enough to move yet.
33) KENNY
{ThinkingA} We�re all a little spooked. {AngryA} All the more reason to get down to the river to find a boat so we can {AngryB} get the hell out of here.
164) KENNY
{ThinkingA} We�re all a little spooked. {AngryA} All the more reason to get down to the river to find a boat so we can {AngryB} get the hell out of here.
34) KENNY
{AngryB} All right, that�s it. {AngryA} We�ve stuck around here long enough. It�s time to get back on track, time to get {ThinkingA} down to the river and find ourselves a boat.
35) BEN
{FearB} I don�t like this one bit. Not one bit.
36) KENNY
[alarmed] {FearA} What? {ThinkingA} Who?
37) CHRISTA
{FearA} Me either. {NormalB} Walkers are one thing, but the {AngryA}thought of someone out there actually stalking us...
38) LEE
{ThinkingA} I can�t be sure, they ran off before I could get a good look.
39) BEN
{FearA} Lee saw someone watching us from outside the gate.
40) BEN
{FearA} Lee thinks he might have seen someone out there, spying on us.
41) KENNY
Sure it wasn't just a walker?
42) LEE
[shaking his head] Too fast.
43) KENNY
{ThinkingA} Maybe it�s that goddamn bell-ringer...
44) BEN
{FearA} Man, remember when walkers were what we were most afraid of? {SadA} Those are starting to seem like the good old days.
45) KENNY
{AngryA} Well, to hell with this. I�m not gonna let {AngryB} whoever it is out there keep us from getting our boat. {ThinkingA} We�ve holed up here long enough, {AngryB} I�m headed down to River Street.
46) LEE
I don�t know, I�m tired. Mind�s playing tricks on me, is all.
47) CHRISTA
{NormalB} He knows what he saw, {AngryA}he just doesn�t want to tell us. {AngryB} Lee, what the {FearA}hell happened out here?
48) LEE
I don�t know.
49) KENNY
{AngryA} All right, that�s it. We�ve been cooped up here less than an hour and already we�re going stir crazy.{AngryB}  It�s time to get back on track, {ThinkingA} go get ourselves a boat.
50) LEE
[intense] {NormalC} Did you hear what I said? {AngryA} Anything or anyone.
51) BEN
{HappyA} I�ll go get my stuff.
52) KENNY
{ThinkingA} Well then hell, {AngryA}what are we waiting for?
53) LEE
{NormalB} That�s not how it is. Way I figure it, you�ve got the most important job out of all of us. I�m leaving Clementine in your care. {NormalC} You understand what that means?
54) KENNY
{NormalC} No. Ben, you'll only slow us down. Lee and I can go scout the river while the rest of you get ready to move out. {AngryA} You stay behind with Christa and Omid.
91) KENNY
{NormalC} No. Ben, you'll only slow us down. Lee and I can go scout the river while the rest of you get ready to move out. {AngryA} You stay behind with Christa and Omid.
55) LEE
{NormalB} I'm with Kenny, {NormalD} the sooner we get the hell out of here, the better.
56) LEE
{Body-F}{NormalD} Clem, honey. I think it�d be best if you stayed here with Ben. {NormalB}I need you to watch out for Omid and Christa, help them get ready to move out.
57) CLEMENTINE
[a little upset] You said I�m supposed to {SadB}always stay close to you.
58) LEE
{NormalD} I know. {NormalB} It�s just this once. Sometimes we all have to put aside what we want for the good of the group. {HappyA} Hey, don�t worry. I�ll be back before you know it. Okay?
59) KENNY
{ThinkingA} Daylight�s burning. {NormalC} Gonna go grab my gear, then we�ll head out.
137) KENNY
{ThinkingA} Daylight�s burning. {NormalC} Gonna go grab my gear, then we�ll head out.
139) KENNY
{ThinkingA} Daylight�s burning. {NormalC} Gonna go grab my gear, then we�ll head out.
141) KENNY
{ThinkingA} Daylight�s burning. {NormalC} Gonna go grab my gear, then we�ll head out.
144) KENNY
{ThinkingA} Daylight�s burning. {NormalC} Gonna go grab my gear, then we�ll head out.
146) KENNY
{ThinkingA} Daylight�s burning. {NormalC} Gonna go grab my gear, then we�ll head out.
60) CLEMENTINE
{NormalB} Wait, can�t I come? {ThinkingA} My mom and dad can�t be far now, {NormalB} maybe we can look for them on the way to the river.
61) CHRISTA
So you�re just going to leave us here, with... whoever that was on the radio still out there?
62) LEE
We don�t have much of a choice, Christa. Can�t stay here. The plan�s always been to get to that boat, nothing�s changed. You�ll be safe until we get back.
63) LEE
{NormalC} Good.
155) LEE
{NormalC} Good.
64) CHRISTA
{NormalB} Come on Clem, let�s go see if Omid needs anything.
113) CHRISTA
{NormalB} Come on Clem, let�s go see if Omid needs anything.
138) CHRISTA
{NormalB} Come on Clem, let�s go see if Omid needs anything.
140) CHRISTA
{NormalB} Come on Clem, let�s go see if Omid needs anything.
142) CHRISTA
{NormalB} Come on Clem, let�s go see if Omid needs anything.
143) CHRISTA
{NormalB} Come on Clem, let�s go see if Omid needs anything.
145) CHRISTA
{NormalB} Come on Clem, let�s go see if Omid needs anything.
65) BEN
[pickup][frustrated]So, you're just gonna leave me on the bench here?
66) BEN
[unsure] {FearA} I think so.
67) LEE
[deadly serious] {NormalC} Well, just so we�re clear. While I�m gone, anything or anyone tries to get inside this house, {AngryA} you shoot them. Don�t even think twice about it. {AngryB} Understand?
68) BEN
{AngryA} I got no problem shooting walkers.
69) 
The sooner we leave the better.
70) 
It�s not safe yet.
71) LEE
{NormalD} I don�t know if it�s safe to leave just yet.
72) KENNY
{AngryA} Why the hell not? {NormalC}Walkers look to have cleared out.
73) LEE
{FearA} That�s not all I�m worried about.
74) KENNY
{AngryA} So you�d rather just hunker down here and just let whoever�s out there keep us boxed in? {ThinkingA} Wait for them to starve us out? {NormalC} No thanks.
75) CHRISTA
{AngryA} I hate to say it, {NormalB}but Kenny�s right. Omid�s not in great shape to move, but {FearA}we can�t do anything for him here. {NormalB} Without meds or a doctor, {SadA}he�s only going to get worse.
76) LEE
{NormalC} All right, all right. {NormalB} I�ll head to the river with Kenny to scope out a boat while you get Omid ready to move.
77) KENNY
{AngryB} Well, what the hell else then?
78) LEE
{ThinkingA} Nothing specific. {NormalD} Just got a bad feeling, is all.
79) BEN
{HappyA} Hell, I�ve had one of those since the {FearA}dead started getting up and eating people.
80) KENNY
{NormalC} We�ve come too far to quit now. {ThinkingA} I�m going down to that river to secure us a boat. {AngryA} Now are you coming with, or would you rather stay here and {ThinkingA} nurse that bad feeling of yours?
81) LEE
{NormalC} All right, all right. I�m coming.
82) 
Let's look here for supplies.
83) LEE
Maybe we should search the house before we abandon it.
84) KENNY
We searched it already. Whoever was here before us cleared the place out.
85) LEE
{NormalD} We only checked the house to make sure it�s secure, {NormalC} we didn�t really toss the place. We�re low on food, water, meds, ammo... {ThinkingA} we should make sure there�s nothing here we can use before we move out.
86) KENNY
{NormalC} You search it if you wanna. I�m done with his house. {ThinkingA}We came to this city to find a boat, and that�s just what I�m gonna do.
87) BEN
{FearA} Maybe it�s not such a bad idea to check the place one more-[cut off]
88) KENNY
[interrupting/severe] {AngryC} I SAID I'M DONE WITH THIS HOUSE.
89) LEE
{NormalD} We can do both. {NormalB} Ben, you take one last look around the place, grab anything that looks useful, while me and Kenny go down to the river to get us a boat.
90) BEN
{HappyA} Me too.
92) BEN
{FearA} What about me?
93) KENNY
{NormalC}You�ll stay here with the group. {ThinkingA} You'll only slow us down.
95) CHRISTA
{AngryA} Lee! {FearA} Say something! Tell him we�re not ready to leave yet! {SadA} Omid can barely even walk!
96) KENNY
{ThinkingA} Is he gonna be any more ready to leave tomorrow, after that wound of his has had another day to fester? {AngryA} His best chance - {ThinkingA} our best chance - {NormalC} is to get the hell out of here before our situation gets any worse.
97) CHRISTA
[to Lee] {SadA} Are you just gonna sit this one out?
98) BEN
{FearA} Kenny�s right, Christa.  {NormalB} The sooner we find someplace else, the better.
99) LEE
It�s gonna be fine, Christa. River Street�s just a few blocks away, Kenny and me will head down there and secure a boat. Ben can stay here and guard the house while you get Omid ready to move. If we have to, we�ll carry him to the river.
100) LEE
I gotta go with the majority. The plan�s always been to find a boat that can take us someplace safer than here, if anything we need that now more than ever.
101) CHRISTA
{AngryA} Great, just great.
102) LEE
[shouting, aggressive] {AngryA} You come back here, I'll kill you! {FearA} You understand? {AngryC} I'll kill you!
103) LEE
[shouting] {FearA} Who are you? {AngryB}What the hell do you want from us?!
104) 
I'll kill you!
105) 
Stay away from us!
106) 
Who are you?
107) 
Silent
108) 
Stay here and help.
110) 
Absolutely not.
114) 
We need to focus on the boat.
115) 
Stay and protect Clementine.
116) 
No offense Ben, but...
117) 
Keep an eye on Omid.
118) LEE
[calling out] {SurpriseA} Hey. Hey!
119) LEE
{Body-F}{NormalB} We need to focus on finding a boat right now, Clem. {NormalD} Like we talked about on the train, remember?
120) CLEMENTINE
[disappointed but accepting] {SadA} Okay.
127) CLEMENTINE
[disappointed but accepting] {SadA} Okay.
128) CLEMENTINE
[disappointed but accepting] {SadA} Okay.
131) CLEMENTINE
[disappointed but accepting] {SadA} Okay.
132) CLEMENTINE
[disappointed but accepting] {SadA} Okay.
133) CLEMENTINE
[disappointed but accepting] {SadA} Okay.
121) 
We have to stick together.
122) 
We can't right now.
123) LEE
{Body-F}{NormalD} We can't right now.
124) LEE
{Body-F}{NormalB} We will, but right {ThinkingA} now we all need to focus on finding a boat.
125) LEE
{NormalD} I know I did, sweet pea. I haven't forgotten. {NormalB}But Savannah's more dangerous than I thought it would be. {ThinkingA}We all need to stick together as a group.
129) LEE
{NormalD} I know I did, sweet pea. I haven't forgotten. {NormalB}But Savannah's more dangerous than I thought it would be. {ThinkingA}We all need to stick together as a group.
126) CLEMENTINE
{SadA} But what about what you promised? [discreetly] {NormalA} You said it was going to be just you and me.
130) CLEMENTINE
{SadB} But you promised we'd go find them when we got here. On the train, you promised.
134) LEE
{Body-F}{NormalC} There's no way I'm letting you go back out there.
135) LEE
{HappyA} Kenny and I will be fine. {NormalB} You're going to stay right here where it's safe. {NormalC} No arguments.
136) CLEMENTINE
{AngryA} But maybe I can help!
147) LEE
{NormalC} No offense, Ben, but I'd feel safer if you stayed here.
148) BEN
{SadA} How am I not supposed to take offense to that. {SadB} What am I, a liability?
149) BEN
{AngryB} Great. Just great. {AngryA}Thanks a lot for the vote of confidence.
157) BEN
{AngryB} Great. Just great. {AngryA}Thanks a lot for the vote of confidence.
150) LEE
{NormalC} Confidence is earned, Ben. {NormalB}And you've got a long way to go to earn yours back after some of the stuff you've pulled. {NormalC} You feel me?
151) BEN
[glumly accepting] {SadA} Yeah. I guess you're right.
152) BEN
[pickup][furstrated, sighs]He's got Christa for that.
153) LEE
[intense] {NormalC} If it comes down to it, I can't rely on Christa to do what has to be done. {NormalD} Not with Clementine in the same house. {NormalC}You understand what I'm saying?
154) LEE
{NormalD} I'm worried about Omid, he's in bad shape. {NormalB} I need you to stay here, keep and eye on him.
156) BEN
[grim realization] {FearA} Yeah. You can count on me.

[pickup][still emotional, recovering from his  breakdown. take your time with this line]I'm fine. Just... I'm fine. What's all the ruckus?
166) LEE
[pickup]That's not how it is, Ben. I need you to stay here and keep an eye on Clementine.
167) BEN
[pickup] [pissed off] Yeah. Yeah I feel you.
168) BEN
[pickup] How am I supposed to not take offense to that? What am I, a liability?
169) BEN
[pickup] [confident] I can do that.
