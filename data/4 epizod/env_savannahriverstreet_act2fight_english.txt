[hushed]Where�d he go?
271) KENNY
[hushed]Where�d he go?
10) LEE
[hushed] Maybe he�s just another scavenger, like us.
11) KENNY
[hushed]How about we go find out?
12) KENNY
[hushed]And maybe he ain�t. Maybe he�s that fucker on the radio who�s been messing with Clementine�s head. Don't you wanna know? 'Cause I wanna know.
13) KENNY
[hushed] Okay, you head up the middle of the street, I�ll go around the side, cover your flank. We�ll come up on him quiet, take him by surprise.
14) KENNY
[hushed]Oh, we�re gonna talk.
15) LEE
[hushed]We just want to talk to this guy.

22) LEE
Slowly.
23) CLEMENTINE
[off-screen/horrified] No!
25) CLEMENTINE
[to hooded figure] Please... don�t hurt him!
27) LEE
[urgent] Kenny, don�t!
28) LEE
No! He�s with us!
29) KENNY
[horror/disbelief] What the fuck...?
30) MOLLY
Who the hell are you people?
31) LEE
I asked you first.
218) 
I asked you first.
32) MOLLY
Who�re you calling lady? The name�s Molly.
33) LEE
Molly. I�m Lee, this is Kenny and Clementine. We�re not looking for any trouble.
223) LEE
Molly. I�m Lee, this is Kenny and Clementine. We�re not looking for any trouble.

[cheerily/friendly] Hi.
234) CLEMENTINE
[cheerily/friendly] Hi.
35) MOLLY
You guys really aren�t from Crawford, are you?
222) MOLLY
You guys really aren�t from Crawford, are you?
36) LEE
I don�t even know what that is.
37) MOLLY
Everything beyond that barricade.
38) MOLLY
When everything started going to shit, some people got together and sealed off that whole neighborhood. Folks willing to do anything to stay alive, stop the dead getting in. I try to avoid �em.
39) KENNY
Why?
168) CLEMENTINE
Why?
40) MOLLY
Let�s just say they have a zero-tolerance policy for anyone who won�t - or can�t - live by their rules.
41) KENNY
So how�d you know we weren�t them?
42) MOLLY
Because there are no children in Crawford. Not any more.
43) 
Why no children?
44) LEE
What do you mean, no children? Why not?
45) MOLLY
No children, no elderly, no-one with an advanced medical condition. Basically no-one who might be a burden on the community. Crawford�s all about the survival of the fittest. That�s how they survived, while the rest of the world went to shit around them.

[appalled] Jesus Christ...
162) KENNY
[appalled] Jesus Christ...
47) MOLLY
Well, just the opposite, when you think about it.
160) MOLLY
Well, just the opposite, when you think about it.
48) 
Who�s been ringing those bells?
49) LEE
Do you know who�s been ringing those bells all over town?
50) MOLLY
Yeah, that would be me.
51) KENNY
I knew it! Lee, I knew she was the one who�s been following us, fucking with us!
52) MOLLY
[cool/menacing] Get that finger out of my face, grampa, before I jam it straight up your ass. I haven�t been following you. I don�t even know who the hell you people are.
165) MOLLY
[cool/menacing] Get that finger out of my face, grampa, before I jam it straight up your ass. I haven�t been following you. I don�t even know who the hell you people are.
53) KENNY
Yeah, well. Whoever you are, ringing those bells this morning nearly got us all killed, raised the dead all around us!
54) MOLLY
That�s the idea, genius. It�s how I get around. I ring a bell in one neighborhood to attract the local geeks toward it, buys me some time to scavenge the areas they cleared out.
166) MOLLY
That�s the idea, genius. It�s how I get around. I ring a bell in one neighborhood to attract the local geeks toward it, buys me some time to scavenge the areas they cleared out.
55) LEE
[impressed] That's pretty smart, with the bells.
205) LEE
[impressed] That's pretty smart, with the bells.
56) MOLLY
Doesn�t take much to outsmart the dead. Bunch of dumb-asses. You just gotta move fast, get in and out before they start to wander back again.
203) MOLLY
Doesn�t take much to outsmart the dead. Bunch of dumb-asses. You just gotta move fast, get in and out before they start to wander back again.
57) 
Was that you at our back fence?
58) LEE
Clem, what the hell are you doing here? How�d you get out of the house?
59) CLEMENTINE
Omid started getting really sick, Christa and Ben had to take him upstairs. I didn�t just want to sit around there, I wanted to come help.
60) MOLLY
Really? Because if it weren�t for her showing up when she did I would�ve beaten your brains out.
61) LEE
That�s debatable.
62) MOLLY
[not buying it] Uh-huh.
63) 
Clem, what are you doing here?
64) 
What did Crawford do to them?
65) LEE
What exactly did Crawford do with all these �burdens?� What happened to them?
66) KENNY
Fuck me...
206) KENNY
Fuck me...
67) LEE
But still... children? You�re not saying that they...? [trails off]
68) MOLLY
No, they saved that for the sick and the old. Said it was humane. Kids and their parents, they just kicked them out into the world, let them fend for themselves out here.
69) KENNY
In God�s name, why?
70) MOLLY
No-one stays in Crawford unless they can pull their own weight. Otherwise you�re just another mouth to feed, another drain on their precious resources.
71) CLEMENTINE
What does that mean, pull their own weight?
72) LEE
It just means being able to help out. Like you do all the time.
73) KENNY
Doesn�t sound like any kinda way to live to me.
74) MOLLY
[darkly/ominous] Couldn�t agree more.
75) LEE
How do you know all this?
178) LEE
How do you know all this?
180) LEE
How do you know all this?

286) LEE
How do you know all this?
76) MOLLY
Everyone in Savannah knew. What was going on inside Crawford got passed around like a ghost story. Except this one was true.

77) 
But still... children?
78) 
That�s not how we do things.
79) LEE
That�s not how our group does things.
80) KENNY
[dismayed] You�re not saying they actually... I mean, kids?
81) MOLLY
No. The children they just forced to leave, along with their parents. Left them to fend for themselves out here in the world.
82) MOLLY
Like I said, zero tolerance. Crawford got rid of anyone that couldn�t pitch in, pull their own weight. Way they looked at it, those people were just a lot of useless mouths to feed. A drain on their precious resources.
83) CLEMENTINE
[concerned] What happened to all the children?
88) CLEMENTINE
[concerned] What happened to all the children?
84) MOLLY
The town leaders got rid of anyone that couldn�t pitch in, justify the protection Crawford gave them. To them, a kid was just another mouth to feed, one that can�t pull their own weight in return.
87) MOLLY

85) KENNY
[disgusted] That�s just goddamn wrong. That�s sick!
86) KENNY
[disgusted] That�s just goddamn wrong. That�s sick!
89) LEE
Molly, is there-
90) MOLLY
[annoyed] Hey! Moron! You wanna keep your voice down?
91) CLEMENTINE
Isn�t there another way back to the house?
92) LEE
The way we came.
93) KENNY
There�s gotta be something.
94) MOLLY
If there was, do you think I�d still be here? I�ve been over every inch of this city, this whole place is picked clean.
95) KENNY
[quietly defeated] Shit.
96) MOLLY
Since you�re not getting on any boat, I�d advise you folks to go back where you came from, before-
97) KENNY
Isn�t that-
98) KENNY
[Agitated, distraught] Goddammit! Fuck!
99) MOLLY
Great. Just great.
100) MOLLY
Look, I�m gonna ask you people again: you�re not from Crawford, so who the hell are you? What are you doing here?
101) LEE
We came down here looking for a boat, hoping to get our people out of here and find someplace safe.
102) MOLLY
Good luck with that. Anyone with a boat took it out of here as soon as people started eating each other. Any that got left behind, Crawford stripped �em for parts. Cars too.
103) 
You�re just going to leave us?
104) CLEMENTINE
[calling out]Don�t leave us here! Please?
105) MOLLY
[calling out]Sorry, I must have missed the part of our conversation where you became my problem.
106) LEE
[calling out]Hey! You�re just going to leave us here?
107) 
Is there another way out of here?
109) LEE
[calling out]Is there another way out of here?
108) 
What the hell are you doing?
110) MOLLY
[calling out]Don�t know, don�t care.
111) KENNY
[calling out]So what the hell are we supposed to do?
112) MOLLY
[calling out]I refer you to my previous answer.
113) CLEMENTINE
[calling out]But you have to help us! Please!
114) LEE
[calling out]What the hell do you think you�re doing?
115) MOLLY
[calling out]I�ll tell you what I�m not doing. I�m not getting eaten.
116) KENNY
[calling out]And what about us?
117) MOLLY
[calling out]What about you?
118) CLEMENTINE
[calling out]Please, you can�t just leave us!
119) CLEMENTINE
[calling out]No! Please! Please don�t leave us!
120) KENNY
[to Lee] You�re just gonna let her go? [to Molly] Hey! You can�t just leave us here!
121) MOLLY
[calling out]Really? Watch.
122) KENNY
[sounds of straining to reach]
128) LEE
[sounds of straining to reach]
287) 
...
288) 
...
123) KENNY
Come on man, one good jump!
124) MOLLY
[calling out]Come on! Make it fast!
125) KENNY
[seeing the zombies box them in] Oh, fuck me...
126) LEE
Come on, come on, hurry!
127) CLEMENTINE
Lee! Come on!
129) KENNY
[hitting the ground] Gaaaah!
130) CLEMENTINE
[horrified] Nooo! Lee!
131) 
Shoot
132) 
Attack
133) LEE
No use, too many of them!
134) LEE
No use, too many of them!
135) LEE
[calling out]Clem! Don�t wait for me, get out of here now! Kenny, get her back to the house!
137) LEE
[frustrated] Gah! Can�t get it open!
138) MOLLY
[calling down]Here! Use that to pry it open!
139) 
Open
140) 
Pry
141) CLEMENTINE
[distraught!] Leeeeeee!
142) KENNY
Fuck! Gunshot must've brought 'em back.
143) CLEMENTINE
[calling down, panicked]Lee! Hurry!
144) KENNY
[calling out]C'mon Lee, get your ass outta there!
145) 
Crawford?
247) 
Crawford?
146) 
Have you been following us?
191) LEE
Have you been following us?
249) 
Have you been following us?
250) LEE
Have you been following us?
147) 
You're not the guy on the radio.
190) LEE
You're not the guy on the radio.
244) 
You're not the guy on the radio.
245) LEE
You're not the guy on the radio.
148) 
Kenny, don't!
149) 
Get her!
151) LEE
[urgent] Get her!
150) 
It's not our guy!
152) LEE
[urgent] Kenny, no! It's not our guy!
153) 
What's Crawford?
154) 
I don't have to tell you anything.
192) LEE
I don't have to tell you anything.
155) LEE
What the hell happened here?
156) CLEMENTINE
What happened to the people here?
157) KENNY
What is that, anyway?
175) KENNY
What is that, anyway?
158) CLEMENTINE
We're not from Crawford. Promise.
176) CLEMENTINE
We're not from Crawford. Promise.
159) CLEMENTINE
So... why aren't there any kids in Crawford?
163) MOLLY
Because Crawford doesn't allow them.
164) KENNY
[getting impatient]So why the fuck have you been following us?
167) KENNY
[confrontational]  Yeah, well, ringing those bells this morning nearly got us all killed, raised the dead all around us!
169) 
We're looking for a boat.
170) 
We're just trying to survive.
171) KENNY
And the only way we're gonna survive is by getting on a boat and gettin' the hell out of here.
172) LEE
We�re just trying to survive, same as you.
173) 
I need to get her back to the house.
174) MOLLY
You sure you wanna know?
252) MOLLY
You sure you wanna know?
253) MOLLY
You sure you wanna know?
254) MOLLY
You sure you wanna know?
181) 
Maybe it's just a scavenger.
182) 
We're not looking for trouble.
183) LEE
Sounds like a plan.
216) 
Sounds like a plan.
186) KENNY
Yeah well, it seems to have a way of finding us anyways. Look, this could be the guy from the radio, the one who's been messing with us. If he is, we can put an end to it, right now.
187) LEE
We didn't come here looking for trouble.
188) KENNY
No objections? Good.
189) MOLLY
I'm not a guy at all. Full marks for observation.
246) MOLLY
I'm not a guy at all. Full marks for observation.
193) MOLLY
Nice, you're gonna go far with that attitude.
194) LEE
No, I'm from Macon. Kenny here's from Florida.
195) KENNY
She didn't ask for our life stories, Lee. [to Molly] What's the deal with this Crawford place?
196) LEE
Calm down, Kenny. The voice on the radio was a guy, remember?
197) LEE
Was that you at our house this morning? Watching me through the back fence?
198) MOLLY
Hell no. Believe it or not, I've got better things to do with my time.
199) LEE
I told you we didn't need any help.
200) KENNY
Geeks? Is that what you call them?
202) KENNY
Geeks? Is that what you call them?
201) MOLLY
Yeah. You know, like at the carnival. They'll eat anything, alive or dead.
204) MOLLY
Yeah. You know, like at the carnival. They'll eat anything, alive or dead.
207) MOLLY
Well, you met some of them already.
208) MOLLY
Yeah. Anyone who got sick, anyone too old, anyone they figured wasn't strong enough to survive. To them those people were just mouths to feed, a drain on their precious resources.
209) LEE
Look, I'm sorry we bothered you. I just want to get her  back home.
210) KENNY
We're not going anywhere until I find us a goddamn boat!
211) KENNY
Believe me, we're just passing through. As soon as I find us a boat that'll float we'll be outta here.
212) KENNY
Believe me, we're just passing through. As soon as I find us a boat that'll float we'll be outta here.
213) KENNY
Believe me, we're just passing through. As soon as I find us a boat that'll float we'll be outta here.
