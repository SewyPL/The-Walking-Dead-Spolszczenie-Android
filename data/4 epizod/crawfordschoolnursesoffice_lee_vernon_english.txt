How's it coming?
6) LEE
{normalD}How's it coming?
2) VERNON
Not well. Did you get that battery yet?
3) LEE
We did, but Molly took off with it. She said she'd be back, but I don't know what's going on with her.
4) LEE
Workin' on it.
5) LEE
{normalD}Hey Vernon?
7) VERNON
{thinkingA}Slow. Too slow. I'm worried that by the time we manage to get this thing open, it may be too late.
8) LEE
{happyA}I'll go see if I can find something that'll help us get that safe open.
9) VERNON
{thinkingA}Look, we don't have time to just sit around. We need to get this safe open.
10) 
Bye.
11) LEE
{happyA}Molly helped me get the battery we needed.
12) VERNON
{thinkingA}Took off... with the battery?
13) VERNON
{happyA}That's great, one down. Where is she?
14) VERNON
{thinkingA}I hope so. That girl doesn't really strike me as a team player. More the mercenary kind.
15) LEE
{thinkingA}She took off, had some kind of errand she needed to run.
16) LEE
{normalD}Yeah. Don't worry, {thinkingA}she'll be back.
17) LEE
{fearA}How much time do you think Omid has, doc?
18) VERNON
{sadB}You want my medical opinion? {thinkingA}The sooner we get him some strong antibiotics to start fighting that infection, the better. Let's just leave it at that.
19) LEE
{happyA}Hey doc, I just wanted to thank you for coming with us, and for all your help. I really appreciate it.
21) LEE
Hey doc, I just wanted to thank you for coming with us, and for all your help. I really appreciate it.
24) LEE
{happyA}Hey doc, I just wanted to thank you for coming with us, and for all your help. I really appreciate it.
20) VERNON
[grumpily] {angryA}Don't thank me. I'm not doing this for you, I'm doing it for my people. {thinkingA}They need this medicine as badly as your friend does.
22) VERNON
{happyB}Don't mention it. It's times like these we've got to help each other the most, right? {angryA}Or we're no better than those Crawford sons-of-bitches.
23) LEE
{happyA}I heard that.
25) VERNON
{happyA}Good idea.
26) 
About Molly...

About Omid...

Thank you for coming with us.
