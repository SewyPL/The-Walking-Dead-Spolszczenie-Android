1) LEE
{NormalB}Okay, you get started, I�ll take a look around, see if I can find anything useful.
2) VERNON
Yeah - that�s our other problem. Take a look.
3) VERNON
{ThinkingA}Maybe, with enough time. But I don�t know how much of that we have. {NormalB}Be a hell of a lot quicker if we just knew the four digit combination.
4) LEE
Calm down. I took care of them. What about the meds, did we find what you need?
5) CHRISTA
[frantic] They wandered into the hallway after we got inside. I think they must have heard us rooting around in here. This whole place is infested, they�re everywhere!
6) VERNON
Looks like they were keeping all the prescription meds in that safe - locked up tight.
7) LEE
{ThinkingB}There�s no way we can bust it open?
8) LEE
What the hell happened?
9) CHRISTA
{AngryA}Well I doubt they just wrote it down and left it here for us to find. We should just try busting it open, we don�t have any other choice.
10) CHRISTA
It�s a sonogram.
11) LEE
[lookat]What�s this on the floor?
12) LEE
[lookat]There�s dried blood on this printout. And on the floor. Looks like a trail of it, from the safe to that camera over there, then out the door. What the hell happened here?
13) LEE
Someone definitely was bleeding in here.
14) VERNON
Not too uncommon for medical center.
15) 
Open

[lookat]No tape inside.

[lookat]The way this camera's set up, it looks like it would have had a pretty good view of that keypad. I wonder if it caught someone punching it in?

[lookat]Anna Correa. I guess she must have been a patient here. And what�s this?
89) LEE
[lookat]Anna Correa. I guess she must have been a patient here. And what�s this?
28) VERNON
That�d be a first.
31) VERNON
That�d be a first.
91) VERNON

[lookat]I think maybe we just got lucky.

Watch tape #1
34) ANNA
[shrieking hysterically] I don�t want any fucking sedative!
35) LOGAN
[pickup]  [from behind camera] Regulations. Oberson has ordered me to keep records of all medical examinations and consultations.
150) LOGAN
[pickup]  [from behind camera] Regulations. Oberson has ordered me to keep records of all medical examinations and consultations.
36) ANNA
I don't want the procedure! I want my baby! I can't do this!
145) ANNA
I don't want the procedure! I want my baby! I can't do this!
37) LEE
Vernon, Christa. Come look at this.
38) VERNON
Maybe you should search it. See what he's got on him.
39) LEE
I think I recognize that doctor. He was one of the walkers out in the alley by the auto shop.
40) CHRISTA
[sickened] What the hell kind of place was this?
41) VERNON
Dammit! We almost had it!
42) LEE
I�m sure.
43) LOGAN
[pickup]  If Oberson finds out that I concealed evidence of a pregnancy... I'm sorry, but these are the rules.
149) LOGAN
[pickup]  If Oberson finds out that I concealed evidence of a pregnancy... I'm sorry, but these are the rules.

[pickup]  I'm going to give you a sedative. It'll make the procedure easier on you.
148) LOGAN
[pickup]  I'm going to give you a sedative. It'll make the procedure easier on you.
45) ANNA
You know what they�ll say!
46) LOGAN
It�ll help you, Anna. It�ll make the procedure go much easier.
47) LOGAN
[pickup] This is day eighty-two since the outbreak... fifteen forty-seven. Doctor Logan in consultation with patient Anna Correa.
154) LOGAN

48) ANNA
Why are you recording this?
155) ANNA
Why are you recording this?
49) LOGAN
Yes I do. Which is why I�m telling you, you need to take care of this now. Even if I could help you, they�d find out eventually, and then it would only be harder on you.
50) LOGAN
[pickup] As you know, the rules are very clear. The termination is mandatory.
146) LOGAN
[pickup] As you know, the rules are very clear. The termination is mandatory.
51) VERNON
Lee, maybe there�s another tape. We�ve got to keep looking.
52) LEE
Like Molly said. The worst kind.
53) ANNA
Oh God, oh God, oh God...
152) ANNA
Oh God, oh God, oh God...
54) LOGAN
[pickup]  Anna, you don't have a choice.
151) LOGAN
[pickup]  Anna, you don't have a choice.
55) ANNA
[cutting him off, pleading] You don't have to tell them. Tell them it was just nausea, that you gave me something for it and it went away.  This is my problem, not yours.
153) ANNA
[cutting him off, pleading] You don't have to tell them. Tell them it was just nausea, that you gave me something for it and it went away.  This is my problem, not yours.
56) LOGAN
[pickup] I need you to brace yourself, Anna. The sonogram confirms that you're pregnant.
147) LOGAN
[pickup] I need you to brace yourself, Anna. The sonogram confirms that you're pregnant.
57) CHRISTA
Well what are you waiting for?
58) LEE
Not yet.
59) VERNON
You find that doctor's body? Did you search him?
60) LEE
Another tape. That code to the medicine cage has gotta be on one of these.
61) LEE
I found another tape.
106) LEE
I found another tape.
62) LOGAN
[pickup] [agony] Aaaaaaargh!
63) VERNON
More importantly, we�ve got the combination.
64) LOGAN
[pickup] I don't make the rules, Anna.
65) LOGAN
[pickup] Have you made a decision?
66) LOGAN
Good girl. Hop up on the table and I�ll get you prepped.
67) ANNA
[calm] I thought you said I didn�t have a choice.
68) ANNA
[calm/introspective] Maybe that's best, I stayed up all last night thinking about this. Why are we even trying to survive, to keep on living, if this is what it takes? If this is what it's turned us into?
69) ANNA
[tearing up, desperate] Doctor, I�m begging you. Please help me.
70) LOGAN
[pickup] No, no, no...
71) LOGAN
[pickup] Maybe one day, when things are different, you can try again. But for now, today, we have to do this.
72) LEE
I think we know what happened to Crawford.
73) LOGAN
[pickup] Well, technically you do. You can terminate the pregnancy, or leave Crawford. Of course that would be a death sentence both for you and your unborn child.
74) 
What�s wrong?
75) LEE
Christa, are you all right? What�s wrong?
76) CHRISTA
It�s nothing. That was just... hard to watch. Don�t worry about me, I�m fine.
77) LEE
All right. Let�s get those meds and get the hell out of here.
78) CHRISTA
You�re right, I�m sorry. Let�s get those meds.
79) LEE
Christa, this isn�t the time. We�ve got a job to do.
80) 
Just get that safe open
81) VERNON
Don�t take too long!
82) VERNON
Okay, I think we�re good. This is more than enough for your people and mine. Let�s go!
83) VERNON
We�re in business.
84) LEE
You go on ahead, I want to make sure we didn�t miss anything. I�ll be right behind you.
85) VERNON
Antibiotics... morphine... we�ll take as much of this as we can carry.
92) LEE
[to himself]
134) CHRISTA
[quiet crying]
93) LEE
You know, I found a third tape in a locker outside. Maybe there's something else on there?
94) CHRISTA
We got the meds for Omid, that's all I care about.
95) VERNON
We'll head back to the classroom. Don't take too long, Lee.
96) LOGAN
My sister needs this medicine. Without it she�ll die. Or she�ll start showing symptoms and the council will come for her. I can�t let that happen.
97) MOLLY
Yeah... that�s the Crawford way, isn�t it?
98) LOGAN
[pickup] Oberson had someone down here yesterday taking inventory, he's really cracking down. I just can't risk it.
99) LOGAN
[pickup] Yes. We HAD a deal. We don�t any more.
100) LOGAN
[pickup] Listen. As fun as this was, I have to put a stop to this little arrangement. This is the last I can give you.
101) LEE
[dry] Well, shit.
102) MOLLY
[dismayed] Why?
103) LOGAN
[pickup] I'm sorry, Molly. I've done all I can. But I have to look out for myself here.
104) MOLLY
We had a deal!
105) VERNON
That's the day after the first one we watched.
107) VERNON
That's the day after the first one we watched.
108) LEE
I found two more tapes.
109) CHRISTA
Put it in.
110) CHRISTA
Put it in.
111) 
Watch tape #3
112) LEE
[lookat]It's a medical file for a woman named Correa.
113) 
Use combination
114) LEE
I found this on the doctor's corpse. Think this combo will open that safe?
115) VERNON
No, it's not the right format. This looks more like a locker combination.
116) LEE
[lookat]This isn't the right combination.
117) LEE
[lookat]Vernon and Christa already took everything we need.
118) LEE
[lookat]Must've been from when that woman stabbed the doctor.
119) CHRISTA
[to herself, frustrated] Goddammit, this is going to take forever.
120) 
Shoot

They got what they deserved.
122)

124) LEE
Looks like the sick system these bastards cooked up to protect themselves wound up destroying them.
125) VERNON
Can't say I'll shed too many tears over it.
126) VERNON
Come on Christa, let's get that safe opened.
127) VERNON
Come on Christa, let's get that safe opened.
128) MOLLY
My sister needs this medicine. Without it she'll die. Or she'll start showing symptoms and they'll take her away. I can't let that happen.
129) LEE
[lookat]Looks pretty sturdy, no way we're gonna force that open.
130) VERNON
We might be able to find something to pry it open, but it'll take time.
131) CHRISTA
We don't have time! Omid needs that medicine! We have to get it open NOW!
132) LEE
Do you think shooting it open would work?
133) VERNON
Only thing that would accomplish is getting us all killed. So, no, I don't.
135) 
Can we bust it open?
136) 
Where else could we look?
137) 
Can we guess the combination?
138) LEE
{ThinkingB}Maybe we should try looking somewhere else for medicine.
139) VERNON
{AngryA}In Crawford? This place is too overrun. No, that safe is our best chance.
140) LEE
{ThinkingA}Can we just guess the combination?
141) VERNON
{AngryA}It's a four digit code. You do the math.
142) VERNON
[sighs]{SadA}It'd be a hell of a lot quicker if we just knew the four digit combination.
143) VERNON
[sighs]{SadA}It'd be a hell of a lot quicker if we just knew the four digit combination.
144) VERNON
[sighs]{SadA}It'd be a hell of a lot quicker if we just knew the four digit combination.
156) LOGAN
[reconsidering][pickup] Now if you like you can take some time with this, but I need you to come back no later than tomorrow. Or I'll have no choice but to inform Oberson myself. I'm sorry.
157) ANNA
