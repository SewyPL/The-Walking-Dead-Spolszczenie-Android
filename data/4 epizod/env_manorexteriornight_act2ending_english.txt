[counting] {ThinkingB} Me, you, Clem, Christa, Omid, Ben, Molly...
10) KENNY
{AngryA} So we�re gonna have a capacity problem. {ThinkingA} Boat that size ain�t gonna hold more than five people, even with one of them a kid.
11) KENNY
{NormalC} Assuming everyone makes it back alive, that�s still one too many, even if we cut Molly loose. {ThinkingA} Before this is over we�re gonna have to make a decision.

23) CLEMENTINE
[despondent] {SadA} I guess.
24) CLEMENTINE
{FearB} What should I do, if something happens while you�re gone?
25) 
[Give her a gun]
26) 
[Tell her to run and hide]
27) LEE
It�s okay, take it.
28) LEE
{Body-F}{NormalC} Here, I want you to take this.
29) CLEMENTINE
{FearB} I remember.
30) LEE
{NormalB} You remember how to use it, don�t you? {HappyA} It�s just like I showed you.
31) LEE
So if anyone tries to get inside the house that isn�t one of us...{NormalD}  or if something does happen to Omid...
32) CLEMENTINE
[grim]{AngryA}  I know what to do.
33) LEE
Hey. Don�t worry. Everything�s going to be okay.

37) LEE
Good girl.
38) LEE
{Body-F}{NormalD} If that happens - if you see or hear anyone outside trying to get in, {NormalC} I want you to find a place to hide and stay there. {NormalD} And don�t come out until I get back.{ThinkingA}  Do you understand?

45) CLEMENTINE
[determined]{HappyA} Ready.
46) LEE
{Body-F} {ThinkingA} I'm not leaving her alone in this house with only Omid to protect her. {NormalC} Just not happening.
47) VERNON
{AngryA} Did you not hear anything I said about the kind of place Crawford is? {ThinkingA} If you take her in there and they find her-
48) LEE
{Body-F} {ThinkingA} This isn�t up for a debate, Vernon. {NormalC} Decision�s made.
49) MOLLY
{NormalA} For what it�s worth, {ThinkingA} I don�t think it�s a great idea either.
73) MOLLY
{NormalA} For what it�s worth, {ThinkingA} I don�t think it�s a great idea either.
50) LEE
{Body-F} This little girl's not just excess baggage. She's gotten us out of a tight spot more than once.
51) KENNY

{NormalC} So we're going to have a {NormalB} capacity problem. Assuming everyone makes it back alive, {NormalC}there ain't gonna be room for everyone.
77) LEE
{ThinkingB} What are you trying to say?
78) KENNY
{NormalB} Just giving you a heads-up, is all. {NormalC} Thought you oughta know.
79) LEE
{NormalB} Good, we're gonna need all the help we can get.
81) LEE
We don't need her. She's just going to slow us down.
86) CLEMENTINE
[determined]{NormalC} I can help. I've been helpful lots of times before.
