1) KENNY
{angrya}[grunt] Hmph. Let�s keep moving.
2) LEE
About what happened back there. In the attic.
3) LEE
Hey, so... you wanna talk about it?
4) KENNY
{angrya}About what?
5) LEE
You sure, man? I mean-
6) KENNY
{angrya}[focused/stoic] No.
7) KENNY
What in the hell is going on?
8) KENNY
[quietly] Son of a bitch. That bastard�s fucking with us again. It�s another trap.
9) KENNY
{angryb}[ignoring him/focused] River's right up ahead.
10) LEE
[quitely] No. Listen. That�s not the same bell as before. This one�s farther off. Whatever it is, it�s gonna get the dead moving over there.
11) KENNY
{angryb}Whatever, man. {angryc}I find whoever�s doing that, I�ll ring their motherfucking bell for �em.
116) KENNY
{angryb}Whatever, man. {angryc}I find whoever�s doing that, I�ll ring their motherfucking bell for �em.
119) KENNY
{angryb}Whatever, man. {angryc}I find whoever�s doing that, I�ll ring their motherfucking bell for �em.
12) LEE
Whatever it is, it�s gonna get the dead moving over there, not here. Maybe doing us a favor.
13) LEE
Good one.
117) LEE
Good one.
118) LEE
Good one.
14) LEE
Still nothing moving behind us, I think we�re--
15) KENNY
{angrya}There�s gotta be a boat...{fearA} there�s gotta be.
16) LEE
Kenny, man... I don�t think so. Maybe we need to come up with a new plan.
17) LEE
Kenny, man, let's just go back to the house and tell the others. Come up with a new plan.
18) 
Look Through
19) LEE
{normalc}[lookat]Great. Needs a quarter to work.
20) LEE
{normalb}[lookat]Don't think I'm going to see anything until I find a quarter.
21) LEE
{thinkinga}[lookat]What the hell are these markings? They're all over the place.
149) LEE
{thinkinga}[lookat]What the hell are these markings? They're all over the place.
22) LEE
{thinkinga}[lookat]Could be military tags. {normalb}But what do they mean?
150) LEE
{thinkinga}[lookat]Could be military tags. {normalb}But what do they mean?
23) LEE
{thinkinga}[lookat]Gas siphoned, tires removed, engine parts missing...
24) LEE
{disgusta}[lookat]Looks like this thing has been stripped clean.
25) LEE
[horrified, to himself] What the fuck? What is this meant to be, some kind of warning? Who would do something like this?
26) LEE
[to himself]Looks like they tried to barricade the street. Did a pretty good job, too.
27) LEE
{normala}[lookat]Might be a good place to look for some change.
28) LEE
[to himself] [lookat]Empty. Yeah, that would have been too easy.
29) LEE
{happya}[to himself][lookat]Hello, beautiful.
30) 
Open
35) 
Open
31) 
Look At
34) 
Look At
56) 
Look At
68) 
Look At
32) LEE
{normalb}[lookat]Empty. Somebody already cleaned this place out.
176) LEE
{normalb}[lookat]Empty. Somebody already cleaned this place out.
33) LEE
{normalb}[lookat]Looks like it�s still intact.
36) LEE
{normalb}[lookat]Locked.
37) 
Bash
42) 
Bash
38) LEE
{happya}Jackpot!
39) LEE
{normala}[lookat]I already got what I needed.
174) LEE
{normala}[lookat]I already got what I needed.
40) LEE
{normalb}[lookat]Still locked.
41) LEE
{normalb}[lookat]Someone already looted the place.
43) LEE
{normalb}[lookat]Damn, built solid.
44) LEE
{thinkinga}[lookat]That ain't gonna work.
45) KENNY
[frustrated] {angryc}Fuck!
46) LEE
What�s up with the boat?
47) KENNY
{angryb}[dejected] It ain�t gonna work. Hull�s cracked beneath the water line, plus someone stripped out the battery.
48) LEE
Let�s find out.
49) LEE
{normalb}[lookat]Can't reach it.
50) LEE
{normalb}[lookat]Just an empty tin can.
51) LEE
[lookat]{normalb}Don't think we're going to find any boats down there.
52) LEE
{normala}[lookat]Maybe there's some change in the drawer.
175) LEE
{normala}[lookat]Maybe there's some change in the drawer.
53) LEE
{thinkinga}[lookat]Just one of those concrete barriers you used to see on the highway.
54) LEE
{normalb}[lookat]Looks like the whole city has been boarded up. For all the good it did.
55) LEE
{thinkinga}[lookat]Must've taken weeks to board up all these windows.
57) 
Shoot
69) 
Shoot
58) LEE
{thinkinga}[lookat]Better not. {normalb}Gunfire would just bring more walkers.
59) KENNY
[desperate/hanging on] {angryb}This IS the plan, Lee! This is our best and only shot! {angryc}You said so yourself back at the house! {angryd}You agreed with me!
60) KENNY
[desperate/frustrated]{angryc}This IS the plan! It's the only one we've got, and you pissin' on it in front of everyone like you did back at the house ain't exactly helping. {angrya}Well screw you, I ain't giving up that easy.
61) KENNY
{normalC}This one might still be salvageable.
62) LEE
[highly skeptical] Seriously?
63) KENNY
{angryb}[snapping] You got a better fucking idea?
64) LEE
I don�t think we should split up too far.
65) KENNY
{normalA}We don�t have to. See that telescope? You can see all the way along the waterfront from right here. See what you can find.
66) LEE
[skeptical but willing to try] Okay.
67) LEE
Yeah, but that was before we--
70) LEE
[lookat]{normalA}Clementine and I got in enough target practice already.
71) LEE
[lookat]{normalA}No, don't wanna draw too much attention.
72) 
You wanna talk?
73) 
You think they're safe at the house?
74) 
I don't think so.
75) 
Time for a Plan B.
76) 
Let's just go back.
77) LEE
Are you sure about that? It doesn't look like it to me. Maybe we need to start thinking about a plan B.
79) KENNY
{normalc}[cooling off] I�ll check it out. You look further along the waterfront. Maybe there�s something at the other end.
80) 
What? Seriously?
81) 
You'd better be right about this.
93) LEE
You'd better be right about this.
82) 
This boat is fucked.
83) LEE
Oh my god.
84) LEE
How much farther to the river?
85) KENNY
[determined/focused] Should be just a few blocks up ahead.
86) LEE
"Just a few blocks" ain't what it used to be.
87) KENNY
Seems quiet enough.
88) LEE
For now.
89) LEE
You think everyone's safe back at the house?
90) KENNY
{angrya}[grim] Safe as anyone can be these days, I guess.
91) LEE
I just hate leaving Clementine alone. As if walkers weren't bad enough, now we've got this crazy motherfucker on the radio stalking us.
92) KENNY
{normalA}Won't be a problem once we get out on the water. River's just a few blocks up ahead.
94) KENNY
{angryb}I said it might be. Gimme a fucking break. I'm a fishing captain, not a miracle worker.
95) LEE
Kenny. Get a grip. This boat is totally fucked.
96) KENNY
{angrya}Oh yeah? {angryb}Know a lot about boats, do ya?
97) LEE
{normalb}[lookat]That barricade does a good job of making me not want to go any further.
98) LEE
{normala}[lookat]Quaint.
99) LEE
You can't fix it?
100) KENNY
{angrya}I'm good, but I'm not that good. What about you? Any luck?
101) LEE
{normalb}You got a quarter on you?
102) KENNY
{thinkinga}Don't have a lot of use for small change these days. {normalb}Maybe you can find one on the street somewhere.
103) KENNY
{angrya}Tell you what - if I ever need an expert opinion on American history - or on committin' murders - I'll be sure to ask. But how about you leave the nautical shit to me?
104) KENNY
Tell you what - if I ever need an expert opinion on American history I'll be sure to ask. But how about you leave the nautical shit to me?
105) LEE
{disgusta}[lookat]Using walkers like scarecrows? What sick bastard did this?
178) LEE
{disgusta}[lookat]Using walkers like scarecrows? What sick bastard did this?
106) LEE
{sada}[lookat]A fate worse than death...
107) 
Use Quarter
108) LEE
Keep your eye out for Chuck. He might be waiting for us around here.
109) KENNY
{angrya}[not really listening]Yeah... sure.
110) 
Maybe they're doing us a favor.
111) LEE
I don't know, but the person ringing that bell might be doing us a favor.
112) 
Maybe they're trying to distract us.
113) LEE
Maybe whoever is ringing that is just trying to distract us. Create a diversion.
114) 
I have no idea.
115) LEE
I have no idea. But someone must be ringing those bells.
120) 
Wait
122) LEE
[to himself]Better just let him do his thing.
123) LEE
{normalb}I'll just have a look around, okay?
124) LEE
{normalb}[to himself][lookat]Must've been a hell of a wreck.

[pickup][while looking through telescope, finding a sunken boat]No way that one's salvageable.
160) LEE
[pickup][looking through a telescope for boats]Plenty of docks. No boats.
161) LEE
[pickup][looking through the telescope for boats]Nothing but water. Not a boat to be seen.
162) LEE
[pickup][looking through a telescope for boats]The Talmadge Memorial Bridge. Can't imagine how many people tried to escape across it when this city started to fall.
163) LEE
[pickup][looking through a telescope]Just an abandoned bridge at this point.
164) LEE
[pickup][to himself]{normalb}I should probably stick close to Kenny. It's too dangerous out here.
