1) VERNON
[calm/non-confrontational] {thinkingA}Who are you?
2) 
I don�t want any trouble.
7) LEE
{fearA}I don�t want any trouble.
3) 
I could ask you the same.
4) 
Nobody.
8) VERNON
[pickup][nervous, voice trembling slightly]Neither do we. {disgustA}Which is why you�d do well to turn around and leave. R-right now.
9) LEE
{angryA}I could ask you the same question.
10) VERNON
[pickup][nervous, voice a little shakey]{angryA}You barged in on us. {surprisedA}And I�m the one holding the gun. {angryA}So I�ll ask you again. {disgustA}Who are you?
11) LEE
{thinkingA}Nobody. I�m just lost, {sadA}trying to get back home.
12) VERNON
[pickup][nervous]{thinkingA}Yeah, well, you took a wrong turn. {angryA}This is our home, not yours. And you�re not welcome here.
13) VERNON
[more agitated, nervous] {disgustA}I said who are you?
14) VERNON
[more agitated, nervous] {disgustA}I said who are you?
15) LEE
{thinkingA}Look, I�m sorry I disturbed you folks.{surpriseA} I�ll just be going.
16) BRIE
{angryC}You can�t let him leave.{angryD} He�s from Crawford! If he goes back there and they find out we�re down here...
17) VERNON
[pickup][nervous, voice tremivling]{disgustA}Are you from Crawford? D-don�t lie to me, I�ll know.
18) LEE
{sadA}No. I�m not any part of that, I swear.
19) BRIE
{angryD}Bullshit!
20) LEE
{thinkingA}I�m not from around here. {normalB}I�m from Athens, grew up in Macon.
21) VERNON
[softening/concerned] {happyA}I have a brother in Macon. {fearB}You were there? How was it? As bad as here?
22) LEE
[grim] {sadB}I�m sorry.
23) BRIE
[still highly suspicious] {angryC}You can�t trust him, Vernon. {angryD}You can�t let him leave.
24) VERNON
[pickup][nervous, shakey] {fearD}W-what do you want me to do, shoot him in the head?
25) BRIE
{angryB}Why not? {angryC}That�d be more of a mercy than anyone from Crawford ever showed us. {fearC}Think, Vernon! What do you think they�ll do if they find out we�re down here, right under their feet?
26) VERNON
[a grim resolve] {angryA}Dammit, you�re right. {sadB}I�m sorry, friend. Can�t take the risk.
27) 
Let's talk about this.
29) 
Let's talk about this.
28) 
[Threaten him]
31) LEE
{normalD}Look. You don�t want to do this. {fearC}Let�s talk, okay?
32) VERNON
[pickup][nervous]{angryA}What�s to talk about? {angryB}You won�t even tell us who you are.
33) LEE
{fearA}My name�s Lee. I�m a history professor. And I don�t want to die today. {thinkingA}And I don�t think you want to kill me either.
34) VERNON
[pickup][nervous]{fearD}Don�t! Don�t come any closer {disgustA}or I�ll shoot!
35) LEE
[calm/negotiating] {happyB}Come on, let's just talk about this.
36) BRIE
[increasingly agitated] {fearC}Vernon, what are you doing? Shoot him!
37) LEE
{fearA}Nobody needs to get shot. Just take it easy.
38) LEE
[totally genuine] There�s a little girl up there who�s relying on me. Her name�s Clementine. She�s eight years old. I�m all she�s got. If I don�t make it back... [too painful to contemplate] You kill me, you kill her too.
39) BRIE
[panicking] Don�t listen to him, he�s messing with you! Shoot him!!
40) LEE
{fearA}It�s all right. It�s okay.
41) BRIE
{fearC}Vernon, what the hell are you doing?!
42) BRIE
{angryD}Vernon!
43) LEE
Relax. I told you I don�t want any trouble.
134) LEE
Relax. I told you I don�t want any trouble.
44) LEE
{thinkingA}Relax. I�m not here to hurt you.
45) LEE
{surpriseA}You threatening me, old man? {angryB}Because you�re not gonna like how that goes. {angryC}Put the fucking gun down before you really make me mad.
46) BRIE
{fearA}He�s bluffing.
47) LEE
{angryC}You think so? Try me.
48) LEE
[voice rising, threatening] I�ve got a little girl back there who�s depending on me. If you think I won�t do anything to get back to her, just try me.
49) VERNON
[nervous/afraid] {angryB}Keep back or I swear I�ll shoot!
139) VERNON
[nervous/afraid] {angryB}Keep back or I swear I�ll shoot!
140) VERNON
[nervous/afraid] {angryB}Keep back or I swear I�ll shoot!
50) LEE
{thinkingB}No. I don�t think so. I know killers, I�ve seen my share. {angryA}You ain�t got the look. {angryB}And that means you ain�t got the balls. [barking] {angryD}Now drop the goddamn gun!
51) BRIE
{fearC}My God. Vernon, what have you done?
52) LEE
You did the right thing.
53) LEE
Okay now.
54) BRIE
{fearC}I told you, he�s lying! He�s one of them! {angryD}Kill him before he kills us!
55) LEE
Who are you people?
56) VERNON
[pickup][still a little nervious]{fearB}You�re really not from Crawford?
57) LEE
{normalD}No. I�m really not.
58) VERNON
[pickup][reluctantly] {fearA}Well... we are. Or were. {fearB}We got out of there when they started sealing up the place, {disgustA}started weeding out the sick and the old so their perfect survivor society wouldn�t be threatened. {angryA}No room for weakness or vulnerability in their little master race.
59) LEE
{thinkingA}You don�t look that old. So... you�re sick?
196) LEE
{thinkingA}You don�t look that old. So... you�re sick?
60) BRIE
Were sick. We�re all members of a cancer survivors group that used to meet here at the hospital.
187) VERNON
Were sick. We�re all members of a cancer survivors group that used to meet here at the hospital.
61) VERNON
{thinkingA}We�re in remission. But that wasn�t good enough for Crawford. {normalA}They�d already rounded up five of us before the rest of us managed to hole up and hide from them down here. This old basement�s been abandoned for years.
62) LEE
{thinkingA}What is this, a morgue?
200) LEE
{thinkingA}What is this, a morgue?
63) VERNON
{thinkingA}Yeah. Irony�s always high on my list when I�m looking for a place to survive. How did you find your way down here?
64) LEE
{normalD}A few of us got boxed in by walkers up on the street, I came down here trying to get away. {sadA}Now I just want to get out of here and get back to my own people.
65) VERNON
{happyA}That sewer system you came through runs all over the city, {happyB}it�ll take you wherever you want to go.
146) VERNON
{happyA}That sewer system you came through runs all over the city, {happyB}it�ll take you wherever you want to go.
149) VERNON
{happyA}That sewer system you came through runs all over the city, {happyB}it�ll take you wherever you want to go.
160) VERNON
{happyA}That sewer system you came through runs all over the city, {happyB}it�ll take you wherever you want to go.
66) 
I�ll be fine on my own.
67) 
Can you show me the way back?
68) BOYD
Vern, you�re not just going to let him go back out there alone, are you? Those sewers are like a maze, he�s got no chance of finding his way back without a guide.
212) BOYD
Vern, you�re not just going to let him go back out there alone, are you? Those sewers are like a maze, he�s got no chance of finding his way back without a guide.
69) BRIE
He found his way here easily enough, didn�t he?
70) LEE
I wouldn�t exactly call it easy. You know, maybe I could use a little help.
71) VERNON
{sadB}Look, I�d like to help you. But we�ve all got our own problems. Two of our group are sick and need constant care. And I�m the only doctor here.
74) VERNON
Look, I�d like to help you. But we�ve all got our own problems. Two of our group are sick and need constant care. And I�m the only doctor here.
162) VERNON
{sadB}Look, I�d like to help you. But we�ve all got our own problems. Two of our group are sick and need constant care. And I�m the only doctor here.
72) BRIE
{angryC}Besides, why should we help you?
75) BRIE
Besides, why should we help you?
161) BRIE
{angryC}Besides, why should we help you?
204) BRIE
{angryC}Besides, why should we help you?
213) BRIE
{angryC}Besides, why should we help you?
73) LEE
{thinkingB}Those sewers are like a damn maze. Any chance you could help me find my way back?
76) 
If you don�t, I�ll kill you.
77) LEE
{normalD}Look, I�m sorry if I scared you. {normalA}I just want to get back to my people. {fearA}Back to Clementine.
78) VERNON
{sadB}She�s your daughter?
79) 
Yes
80) 
No
81) LEE
{fearA}Yeah. She�s probably already wondering where I am.
82) VERNON
{thinkingA}Well we can�t have that, can we?
83) BRIE
{fearC}Vern, what the hell are you doing?
84) VERNON
{sadA}It�s all right, Brie. [to Lee] I had a daughter too.{sadB} Lost her in the first days. {disgustA}I�ll be damned if I�ll just sit back and let that happen to someone else.
85) CLIVE
We need you here!
90) CLIVE
We need you here!
217) CLIVE
We need you here!
86) VERNON
{normalC}Don�t worry. {happyB}I�ll be back before you know it. [to Lee] Let�s go see about your daughter.
87) LEE
{sadA}No. She lost her real parents. I�m doing what I can.
88) BRIE
{fearB}You�re not seriously considering going with him.
105) BRIE
{fearA}You�re not seriously considering going with him.
123) BRIE
{fearA}You�re not seriously considering going with him.
215) BRIE
{fearB}You�re not seriously considering going with him.
89) VERNON
{sadA}It�s all right, Brie. [to Lee] I had a daughter.{sadB}  Lost her in the first days. {disgustA}I�ll be damned if I�ll just sit back and let that happen to some other little girl.
216) VERNON
{sadA}It�s all right, Brie. [to Lee] I had a daughter.{sadB}  Lost her in the first days. {disgustA}I�ll be damned if I�ll just sit back and let that happen to some other little girl.
91) VERNON
{normalC}Don�t worry.{happyB} I�ll be back before you know it. [to Lee] Let�s go.
218) VERNON
{normalC}Don�t worry.{happyB} I�ll be back before you know it. [to Lee] Let�s go.
92) LEE
{fearA}If you�ve got sick people here, maybe I can help. Our group has medical supplies.
93) VERNON
{thinkingA}What kind of medical supplies?
94) LEE
{fearA}I don�t know, all kinds. I�m sure there�s something you could use. {happyA}We�d be happy to trade some for a guide back to where we�re staying.
95) BOYD
Vern. We need medicine. Joyce is in a lot of pain, I can�t bear to see her like this. Maybe it�s worth the risk.
96) VERNON
{thinkingA}Maybe so.
100) VERNON
{thinkingA}Maybe so.
97) BRIE
{AngryD}Vernon, you can�t trust him.{FearD} He burst into our home and threatened us, and now he just happens to have exactly that we need? {angryD}He�s lying.
101) BRIE
{AngryD}Vernon, you can�t trust him.{FearD} He burst into our home and threatened us, and now he just happens to have exactly that we need? {angryD}He�s lying.
98) VERNON
{angryA}Sorry, friend. But Brie�s right.{thinkingA} Maybe if you�d handled yourself different. But as things stand, I can�t help you.
102) VERNON
{angryA}Sorry, friend. But Brie�s right.{thinkingA} Maybe if you�d handled yourself different. But as things stand, I can�t help you.
99) LEE
We have a man wounded back where we�re staying. He could use a doctor.
103) VERNON
How badly wounded? He�s not bitten is he? Because you know...
120) VERNON
How badly wounded? He�s not bitten is he? Because you know...
104) LEE
He�s not bitten. He busted his leg when he took a fall. If you�re a doctor, we could sure use your help.
119) LEE
He�s not bitten. He busted his leg when he took a fall. If you�re a doctor, we could sure use your help.
106) VERNON
He conducted himself like a gentleman. And I took an oath.
122) VERNON
He conducted himself like a gentleman. And I took an oath.
107) BRIE
Vern. Don�t do this. Please. We need you.
124) BRIE
Vern. Don�t do this. Please. We need you.
108) VERNON
Don�t worry. I�ll be back before you know it. [to Lee] Let�s go.
121) VERNON
Don�t worry. I�ll be back before you know it. [to Lee] Let�s go.
109) VERNON
No. I�m sorry. Maybe if you hadn�t barged in here and scared the hell out of my people the way you did. But I�ve seen too many like you to risk trusting you.
125) VERNON
No. I�m sorry. Maybe if you hadn�t barged in here and scared the hell out of my people the way you did. But I�ve seen too many like you to risk trusting you.
110) VERNON
{happyA}It�s all right, Brie.
111) LEE
{thinkingA}You can either show me the way back, or die right here. {angryA}What�s it gonna be?
112) BRIE
[fuming] {angryD}You son of a bitch.
113) LEE
{angryA}Sorry, but it�s like you said, we�ve all got our own problems.
114) LEE
[gesturing with his gun, menacing]{normalB}Because this is your other option.
115) LEE
{normalB}Deal.
116) VERNON
{happyB}I�ll show you the way back to your people. {angryA}And then I hope I never see you again.
117) LEE
[gesturing with his gun, menacing]{normalD}I guess this is your only other option, then.
118) LEE
[pleading]{fearA}No, wait, listen to me.
126) LEE
{thinkingA}Thanks, I think I can figure out my own way back.
127) BRIE
{angryB}Where else can he be from? Everywhere else around here is dead.
128) VERNON
[menacing]{angryB}I think you'd better start talkin'.
129) LEE
{thinkingA}I came here with a small group hoping to find a boat. {normalD}We just want to get out of here. {thinkingA}How about you just let me go?
130) VERNON
[pickup]{happyB}[cold, hopeless]Ain't no boats around here. {angryA}Crawford took everything.
131) LEE
{normalD}Look, I got cornered down here. {sadA}All I want is to get back out to the streets and find my group.
133) BRIE
See?!
135) LEE
{thinkingB}Yeah, I heard.
136) 
I'm not from Crawford.
137) LEE
[calm/negotiating]{thinkingA}I�m not from Crawford, but I saw what they did up there. {disgustB}It made me sick. {normalD}I�m not like them. And I don�t think you are either. {sadA}I think you�re a good man.
138) 
There's a girl who needs me.
141) LEE
{angryA}Now, tell me. Who the hell are you people?
142) 
Walkers.
143) 
We were looking for a boat.
144) LEE
I told you...
145) LEE
{normalD}My group and I were up by the river looking for a boat. Now I just want to just get out of here and find them again.
147) 
That's not important.
148) LEE
{angryA}That's not important right now. {thinkingA}What's important to me is that I get back to my own people.
151) VERNON
[pickup] {thinkingA}Unless... {surprisedA}is anyone in your group sick? Or injured?
152) LEE
[pickup] 	{SadA}Yeah. We got a man hurt pretty bad.
153) VERNON
{sadB}I took an oath, Brie.
154) 
I'm not from around here.
155) 
We're just looking for a boat.
156) 
I'm just trying to get out of here.
157) 
We can help you, we have medicine. [LIE]
158) 
I have to get back to Clementine.
159) VERNON
{thinkingA}If you don't want to answer our questions {disgustA}I think it's best you leave.
163) VERNON
{SadA}You're not going to be able get out of here on your own. But we�ve all got our own problems. {sadB}Two of our group are sick and need constant care. And I�m the only doctor here.

{SadA}You're not going to be able get out of here on your own. But we�ve all got our own problems. {sadB}Two of our group are sick and need constant care. And I�m the only doctor here.
164) BRIE
[panicking] {fearC}Vern, what are you doing?
165) VERNON
[calm/confident] {disgustA}Sorry friend, I'm not buying it.
166) VERNON
{normalA}I've seen my share of murderers since this all started. Seen too many.  If he was the type to do violence he'd have done it already. [to Lee] {angryA}I'm calling your bluff. Your move.
167) CLIVE
[pickup] [sounds too much like Fennoy, this is a black guy but it's not Lee, can we get someone else to read this?] We need you here!

173) LEE
[lookat]{thinkingA}Wonder how much of this was left down here from the 60's.
174) LEE
[lookat]{thinkingA}This would be enough to keep everyone at the house fed for a while. {normalD}If only I could GET to the house.
175) LEE
[lookat]{surpriseA}Wonder if someone's living down here.
176) LEE
[lookat]{thinkingA}If someone IS staying here, I don't wanna be around when they get back.

193) VERNON
[pickup][nervous]{thinkingA}You say you're not from Crawford, but you sure as hell act like it.

201) VERNON
[pickup] You expect us to help you, after the way you busted in here and terrorized us?
202) LEE
[pickup] Hey, if I got in your face a little that's too bad. All this shit that's gone down has made us all a little punchy. I just want to get home.
203) VERNON
