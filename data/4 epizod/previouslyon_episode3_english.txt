We need to help find a boat. It's our best bet at safety.

Okay, but, we'll be IN Savannah and my parents were in Savannah.
12) LEE
Okay. We'll look for them but THEN a boat.

Let's go.
35) LEE
I think we should look for your parents.
36) CLEMENTINE
Really?
37) LEE
Yeah. You need to know if they're okay. And, well, if they're not, what happened to them.
38) LEE
We should go our own way when we get there. Our crew is falling apart. You and I are stronger alone.
39) LEE
Jump, DAMMIT
41) LEE
Fine, you stay here and we'll go with your lady!
42) OMID
The hell you will!
43) LILLY
Shut up, Carley -- I've heard enough out of you.

Can't wait for you to get to Savannah. I know you said Lee wants to help, but your parents want you to come alone, Clementine. I need you to--[radio cuts out]
46) KENNY
