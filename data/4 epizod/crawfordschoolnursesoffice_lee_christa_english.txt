3) 
Making progress?
4) 
About Clementine...
5) 
Are you feeling okay?
30) LEE
{fearA}Are you feeling okay?
6) 
I'd better go
7) 
Wait
8) LEE
{normalD}Okay.
9) CHRISTA
{sadA}Look Lee, I just wanna get back to Omid. Let me do my thing, alright?
10) LEE
{normalD}Christa--
11) CHRISTA
[pickup2]{angryB}I'm busy, Lee. Just let me work.
12) CHRISTA
[frustrated] {angryA}No! {worriedA}Without the combination I don't know how we're going to get this damn thing open. [fearful] If we don't get back to Omid with some medicine soon...
13) LEE
{sadA}It's okay. We'll figure it out.
14) LEE
{fearA}You're right. I'm sorry.
26) LEE
{fearA}You're right. I'm sorry.
15) CHRISTA
[insistent] {SadA}That is not going to happen. {angryA}Do you hear me? {angryB}That is NOT going to happen. {angryC}We're going to get these meds to Omid and he's going to be fine. [upset] He's going to be FINE!
27) CHRISTA
[insistent] {SadA}That is not going to happen. {angryA}Do you hear me? {angryB}That is NOT going to happen. {angryC}We're going to get these meds to Omid and he's going to be fine. [upset] He's going to be FINE!
16) LEE
{normalD}Because leaving her alone with Omid didn't seem any safer.
17) CHRISTA
{thinkingA}Then why did you?
18) CHRISTA
[accusatory] {angryA}What's THAT supposed to mean?
19) LEE
{SadA}No offense, Christa, but Omid's pretty sick. {fearA}If he were to die, with Clementine alone in the house with him...
20) LEE
{thinkingA}I hope I did the right thing bringing Clementine with us. {fearA}This place isn't exactly safe.
21) CHRISTA
{thinkingA}Why shouldn't she be?
22) LEE
{SadA}I know, I know. I just want her to be safe.
23) LEE
{sadA}I hope I did the right thing leaving Clementine back at the house.
24) CHRISTA
{thinkingA}What else were you going to do? Bring her on a dangerous mission?
25) LEE
{sadA}No offense, Christa, but Omid's pretty sick.{fearA} If he dies, with Clementine alone in the house with him...
28) CHRISTA
{angryC}Oh come on, you'd just dug up a rotting dog carcass! {angryB}I'm surprised we weren't ALL throwing up. {sadA}Lee, I'm fine. {SadB}Quit worrying about me, okay? Worry about Omid, we've got to get him these meds!
29) LEE
{fearA}It's just that you've been looking a little pale the past couple of days. You've been throwing up...
31) CHRISTA
{angryA}I'm fine. Why are you asking me that?
32) CHRISTA
{angryA}Yeah, same here.
33) LEE
{SadA}I've got things to do.
34) CHRISTA
{angryA}No offense, but I'm a little busy trying to get this safe open. {sadA}Omid needs that medicine.
35) LEE
{thinkingA}Are you making any progress with the safe?
