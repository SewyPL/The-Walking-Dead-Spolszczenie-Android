1) CLEMENTINE
Can�t I just hold it?
2) LEE
No.
116) LEE
[frantic]No!
123) LEE
[calling out, panicked]No!
3) CLEMENTINE
Just for a little while? We�re getting real close to where my mom and dad are, maybe I can-
4) LEE
I already told you no. Don�t ask me again, okay?
5) CHRISTA
What�s the harm in letting her have it? It doesn�t even work.
6) LEE
You take care of yours, let me take care of mine.
7) CHRISTA
[sarcastic/offended] Sorry I spoke.
8) CHRISTA
His leg�s pretty bad.
9) OMID
I�m fine.
10) CHRISTA
You�re not fine, you need to rest. [to Lee] He needs to rest.
11) 
We need to keep moving.
12) LEE
It�s not safe to stop out here in the open, we need to keep moving. He can rest after we find a boat and get out on the water.
130) LEE
[pickup]It�s not safe to stop out here in the open, we need to keep moving. He can rest after we find a boat and get out on the water.
13) CHRISTA
I don�t know how much longer he can keep on like this. If his leg gets any worse we�re going to have to carry him.
14) KENNY
Or leave him.
15) CHRISTA
What? No, that�s not an option. We can�t-
16) KENNY
Lady, I�ve known you for all of 12 hours - you don�t get to say �we�, unless you mean just you and him.
17) CHRISTA
You know, since this all started, I�ve seen the best come out of a lot of people, and the worst come out of a lot of others. I guess we know which side you came down on.
18) KENNY
There you go again, �we�. There is no �we� - there�s �us� and there�s you and your boyfriend slowing �us� down.
19) CHRISTA
Go to hell, Kenny.
20) KENNY
Ha! You taken a look around lately? It ain�t that long a trip.
21) 
Kenny, how much farther?
22) LEE
Kenny, how much farther to the river front?
134) LEE
Kenny, how much farther to the river front?
23) KENNY
Should be just a few more blocks up ahead.
135) KENNY
Should be just a few more blocks up ahead.
24) CHRISTA
And there�ll be boats there?
136) CHRISTA
And there�ll be boats there?
25) LEE
There sure as hell better be.
137) LEE
There sure as hell better be.
26) KENNY
[determined/mantra] There�ll be boats. Have to be. Have to be.
138) KENNY
[determined/mantra] There�ll be boats. Have to be. Have to be.
27) BEN
It�s going to be okay. Kenny knows what he�s doing.
139) BEN
It�s going to be okay. Kenny knows what he�s doing.
28) 
You�re right, let�s stop.
29) CHRISTA
I said Omid needs to rest! Guys, can we stop for one minute?
147) CHRISTA
I said Omid needs to rest! Guys, can we stop for one minute?
30) KENNY
You can rest all you want once we get out on the water.
148) KENNY
You can rest all you want once we get out on the water.
31) CHRISTA
I�m telling you, he can�t keep going like this.
149) CHRISTA
I�m telling you, he can�t keep going like this.
32) LEE
Come on, I�ll help you.
150) LEE
Come on, I�ll help you.
33) LEE
Yeah, you�re right. Kenny, hold up.
140) LEE
Yeah, you�re right. Kenny, hold up.
34) KENNY
You hold up. I�m headed to the river and getting on a boat.
141) KENNY
You hold up. I�m headed to the river and getting on a boat.
35) LEE
Kenny, goddammit! I said hold up!
142) LEE
Kenny, goddammit! I said hold up!
36) KENNY
Shout a little louder and wake the dead, why don�t ya?
143) KENNY
Shout a little louder and wake the dead, why don�t ya?
37) LEE
Omid needs to take a break, let�s give him a minute.
144) LEE
Omid needs to take a break, let�s give him a minute.
38) KENNY
We�re almost at the river, almost to the boats.
145) KENNY
We�re almost at the river, almost to the boats.
39) LEE
Then it won�t hurt to stop for just one damn minute.
146) LEE
Then it won�t hurt to stop for just one damn minute.
40) 
She�s right, we�re a group.
41) 
Kenny�s right, we can�t slow down.
42) 
I�ll help carry him.
43) LEE
Christa�s right, we�ve all got to look out for each other.
151) LEE
Christa�s right, we�ve all got to look out for each other.
44) KENNY
I�m just saying, I�m getting to those boats. You can keep up, or not.
154) KENNY
I�m just saying, I�m getting to those boats. You can keep up, or not.
45) LEE
[sighs]How much farther?
152) LEE
[sighs]How much farther?
46) KENNY
Should be just a few more blocks to the river front.
153) KENNY
Should be just a few more blocks to the river front.
47) LEE
Christa, Kenny�s right. The longer we stay out in the open the more dangerous it is for all of us.
48) CHRISTA
I�m not leaving him!
49) LEE
No-one�s asking you to. We just gotta keep moving. All of us.
50) CLEMENTINE
Lee, can�t you help him? His leg looks really bad.
51) LEE
Yeah, you�re right. Omid, here, give me your arm.
52) LEE
You need some help with him?
53) CHRISTA
Yeah, that�d be great. Thanks.
54) LEE
Omid, here, give me your arm.
55) CHRISTA
[sarcastic] Thanks a lot for the support.
56) BEN
[to himself]What the hell...?
57) CHRISTA
Maybe this city�s not so dead after all...
58) KENNY
Keep moving. No-one�s ringing that bell, it�s automatic, on a timer.
59) LEE
What kind of church bell goes off at twenty past the hour?
60) LEE
[alarmed]Someone�s up there.
61) BEN
Are you sure? I don�t see anything.
62) LEE
I know what I saw. I�m telling you, there�s someone up in that bell tower! Someone alive!
63) RADIO VOICE
[radio processing]If I were you, I�d get out of the street. Now.
64) CHRISTA
I thought you said that thing didn�t work!
65) 
Who the hell is this?!
70) LEE
[aggressive] Who the hell is this?
66) 
Are you in the tower?
67) LEE
Hello?
68) OMID

69) BEN
Sounded more like a warning.
71) LEE
[urgent] Hello? Hello?
72) LEE
Who is this? Is that you up in the bell tower?
73) OMID
Y�know... "Hello" might have been a place to start.
