1) KENNY
[annoyed] {ThinkingA}I'm working on it, {AngryB}I'm working on it!
2) KENNY
{Body-a}{AngryA}Lady, I {AngryB}ain�t the one who�s bleeding.
3) LEE
{Body-B}{AngryA}Just get us inside, {AngryB}I don't care how you do it!
4) KENNY
[irritated at Lee]{Body-A}{AngryB}Maybe you should come up with some ideas, then.
5) CHRISTA
{Body-A}{SadA}Shit, that�s gonna get infected. {SadB}We�ve got to get him inside, clean him up.
6) LEE
{SadA}Kenny? {ThinkingA}How's that door coming?
7) LEE
{Body-B}{FearB}You okay?
8) OMID
[still hurting] {Body-A}{SadB}Ugh... yeah.
9) LEE
[strenuous effort] Uuuurgh!
10) OMID
[painful cry] Aaaaaargh!
11) OMID
[in agony] {Body-A}{AngryC}Gaaaaaaah!
12) CHRISTA
Come on, baby!
13) OMID
I can�t! It�s caught on my damn leg! Aaaaaargh, shit!
14) CHRISTA
{Body-A}{AngryA}You're not all right. {WorriedA}You've re-opened your wound, you're losing blood and {AngryA}God only knows what might've gotten in there. {worriedA}It could be infected, it could be-
15) LEE
{Body-B}{ThinkingA}How�s he looking?
16) OMID
{Body-A}{PainA}I�m all right.
17) OMID
{Body-A}{ThinkingA}No offense but you {HappyA}really need to work on your bedside manner.
18) 
It probably looks worse than it is.
19) 
She�s right, it looks bad.
20) 
We�ll take care of it.
21) CHRISTA
{HappyA}Thanks.
22) CHRISTA
{Body-A}{AngryA}Just get us inside the house, will you?
23) OMID
{Body-A}{PainA}Except when it�s a bite.
24) LEE
{Body-B}{ThinkingA}Try not to worry, {HappyA}it always looks worse than it really is.
25) LEE
{sadA}Yeah, {ThinkingA}well it�s not a bite. {HappyA}We�re gonna get you fixed up.
26) CHRISTA
{ThinkingA}Lee.
27) LEE
{NormalC}I�m on it.
28) LEE
Yeah?
29) LEE
[smiles] {HappyA}No problem.
30) CHRISTA
{Body-A}{AngryA}Please, we {WorriedA}have to get him inside.
31) LEE
{Body-B}{NormalC}Christa�s right, {SadA}it looks pretty bad.
32) LEE
{AngryA}Quit trying to be a tough guy, Omid. {FearA}Hell, I�d be crying like a baby, {NormalD}my leg looked like that.
33) OMID
{Body-A}{HappyA}You�re as bad as she is! {ThinkingA}I�m telling you, it�s just a- [sudden pain] {PainA}Aaaargh! Jesus!
34) LEE
{NormalC}Don�t worry, {ThinkingA}I�m on it.
35) LEE
I�m on it, just sit tight.
36) OMID
{Body-A}{PainA}Okay. {HappyA}Thanks, man.
37) LEE
{Body-B}{NormalD}She�s just worried about you, man. {ThinkingA}Don�t worry, we�re gonna get you fixed up in no time, {HappyA}just as soon as we�re inside. Okay?
38) CHRISTA
[pickup2]{Body-A}{WorriedA}Please go and help Kenny. {AngryA}We need to get him inside NOW!
39) OMID
Hey, I�m not going anywhere.
40) CHRISTA
[pickup2]{Body-A}{ThinkingA}Lee, will you please see what�s happening with getting us inside? {AngryB}We can�t stay out here like this!
41) OMID
{Body-A}{ThinkingA}Okay, you�re not exactly filling me {PainA}with confidence here.
42) LEE
Hey Clem, come away from the gate, okay? It�s not safe.
43) CLEMENTINE
[anxious] {Body-HandOnWrist}{FearA}Do you think the dead people saw us come back here? {FearB}Are they going to find us?
44) 
No, they didn�t see us.
45) 
I think they did.
46) 
Try not to worry.
47) 
Wait
49) LEE
{Body-F}{HappyA}No, they didn�t see us. {NormalB}We were too fast for them.
50) CLEMENTINE
{Body-HandOnWrist}{FearB}I can still hear them out there. {Body-HandsOpen}{FearC}It sounds like they�re getting closer.
51) LEE
{ThinkingA}It�s just your imagination.
52) CLEMENTINE
{SadA}I�ll feel safer when we�re inside the house.
53) LEE
{Body-F}{SadA}Yeah, {FearA}I think maybe they did.
54) CLEMENTINE
{Body-HandOnWrist}{FearA}I think so too. {Body-HandsOpen}{ThinkingB}I'm standing guard in case they show up.
55) LEE
{HappyA}You don�t need to do that, {NormalC}we�re going to be safe inside real soon. {ThinkingA}Until then, {HappyA}just stay close to me okay?
56) CLEMENTINE
{HappyA}Okay.
57) LEE
{Body-F}{ThinkingA}Try not to worry. Even if they saw us, {NormalC}they can�t get in here.
58) CLEMENTINE
{Body-HandOnWrist}{ThinkingA}We did. {ThinkingB}Why can�t they?
59) LEE
{HappyA}We�re a lot smarter than they are. {ThinkingA}They�re just like dumb animals, {ThinkingB}they can�t open doors.
60) CLEMENTINE
{Body-HandsOpen}{NormalC}I used to have a pet hamster. {ThinkingB}One night he figured out how to open the door to his cage, {NormalB}and when we woke up he�d eaten half a box of cookies.
61) LEE
{HappyA}I don�t think this is quite the same, Clem.
62) CLEMENTINE
{ThinkingA}Yeah, right. {ThinkingB}This time, {FearB}we�re the cookies.
63) LEE
Just stay {ThinkingA}away from the gate. {NormalC}I�m gonna see about getting us inside the house.
64) CLEMENTINE
{Body-HandOnWrist}{FearB}I guess that�s a {Body-HandsOpen}yes.
65) LEE
{Body-B}{NormalC}How�s it coming? {ThinkingA}We find a way in yet?
66) KENNY
{Body-A}{NormalC}Nah, we�d have heard from �em by now, {NormalB}all the racket we�re making. {DisgustA}But whoever was here did a pretty good job fortifying it. {HappyA}Nice place to hole up... {ThinkingA}if we can just figure out how to get in.
67) KENNY
{Body-A}{ThinkingA}All these windows are boarded up good, {AngryA}we ain�t getting in that way.
68) BEN
{Body-A}{ThinkingB}Door�s locked, too. {AngryA}Too heavy to force it.
69) LEE
{Body-B}{ThinkingB}You think maybe someone�s still inside?
70) LEE
{Body-B}{ThinkingB}What�s this? {ThinkingA}Looks like there�s some kind of pet door here.
296) LEE
{Body-B}{ThinkingB}What�s this? {ThinkingA}Looks like there�s some kind of pet door here.
71) KENNY
[accusatory, to Ben] {Body-A}{DisgustA}How the hell did you miss that?
294) KENNY
[accusatory, to Ben] {Body-A}{DisgustA}How the hell did you miss that?
72) BEN
{Body-A} {ThinkingA}I tried it already, that�s locked too.
297) BEN
{Body-A} {ThinkingA}I tried it already, that�s locked too.
73) KENNY
{AngryA}Who the hell ever heard of a locked doggie door?
295) KENNY
{AngryA}Who the hell ever heard of a locked doggie door?
74) OMID
{Body-A}{PainA}I have. {ThinkingA}My neighbor had one just like that. It�s radio-controlled, {NormalB}the dog wears a collar with a chip in it so the door only opens when the dog gets close to it.
293) OMID
{Body-A}{PainA}I have. {ThinkingA}My neighbor had one just like that. It�s radio-controlled, {NormalB}the dog wears a collar with a chip in it so the door only opens when the dog gets close to it.
75) KENNY
{DisgustA}Well, shit. {AngryA}Every day�s a school day.
292) KENNY
{DisgustA}Well, shit. {AngryA}Every day�s a school day.
76) BEN
{NormalB}All right, {NormalC}so... {ThinkingA}where�s the dog?
77) LEE
All we need is the collar...
78) LEE
{Body-B}{NormalC}Empty. {ThinkingA}Yeah, that would {HappyA}have been too easy.
79) LEE
{Body-B}{NormalC}It's empty.
80) LEE
{Body-B}{ThinkingA}A shovel is never not useful.
81) LEE
{Body-B}{DisgustA}Looks like something was buried here.
82) CLEMENTINE
{Body-Stand}{FearB}Are you okay?
83) CHRISTA
{Body-A}{WorriedA}I said I�m fine, okay?
84) LEE
[disgusted]{DisgustB} Aaaagh! Jesus!
85) BEN
[turning away] {Body-A}{FearB}Okay, that is NOT cool.
86) CHRISTA
{Body-A}{SadB}I�m fine, honey.{DisgustA} It�s just the smell.
87) OMID
{Body-A}{FearB}Are you sure you-
88) OMID
{Body-A}{FearA}Hey, be careful. Digging up {ThinkingA}dead things isn�t what it used to be, {FearA}know what I mean?
286) OMID
{Body-A}{FearA}Hey, be careful. Digging up {ThinkingA}dead things isn�t what it used to be, {FearA}know what I mean?
89) LEE
Just do what I {SadA}say, okay?
90) BEN
{Body-A}{DisgustA}Oh God, the smell.
91) LEE
{Body-B}{FearA}Yeah, I hear you.
287) LEE
{Body-B}{FearA}Yeah, I hear you.
92) CLEMENTINE
{Body-Stand}{FearA}What�s buried down there?
285) CLEMENTINE
{Body-Stand}{FearA}What�s buried down there?
93) LEE
{Body-B}{NormalC}Nothing. Clem, {ThinkingA}go over and sit with Christa and Omid, {HappyA}okay?
94) CLEMENTINE
{Body-Stand}{ThinkingA}But I want to-
95) LEE
{Body-B}{ThinkingA}Looks like the collar�s still on it.
96) LEE
{DisgustA}Ugh... I can�t get it off.
97) LEE
{Body-B}{ThinkingA}No way I'm gonna be able to bust through that.
98) CLEMENTINE
{Body-Stand}{HappyC}Ta-da!
99) BEN
{FearB}Be careful, man...
100) CHRISTA
[urgently/worried] {Body-A}{WorriedA}Whatever you�re going to do, do it fast...
101) LEE
{AngryA}Okay, lemme see if I can reach up in there...
102) LEE
[straining] {AngryC}Uugh... it�s no good, {ThinkingA}I can�t get it.
103) BEN
{AngryA}Here, let me try. {ThinkingA}I think I can-
104) LEE
[beside himself] {Body-B}{FearC}Clem! {AngryC}Goddammit, get back here! {FearD}Clementine!
105) BEN
{Body-A}{ThinkingA}You see anything in there?
106) LEE
{Body-B}{normalB}No. {ThinkingA}Looks like it�s been empty a while.
107) LEE
{Body-B}{ThinkingA}Here goes nothing...
108) KENNY
[jubilant] {Body-A}{HappyB}Yes! {HappyC}Goddamn!
109) 
Don�t ever do that again!
110) 
Good job, Clem!
111) 
You should have asked me first.
112) LEE
{AngryB}That�s not the point, that was dangerous and stupid! {FearB}You don�t know what might be in there!
113) LEE
[angry] {Body-B}{AngryC}Don�t ever do {FearB}that again!
114) CLEMENTINE
{Body-Stand}{SadC}I was only trying to help!
115) CHRISTA
{body-A}{AngryB}Little harsh on her, don�t you think?
116) OMID
{Body-A}{FearB}Can we maybe have this conversation inside? {PainA}My leg�s starting to hurt like hell.
126) OMID
{Body-A}{FearB}Can we maybe have this conversation inside? {PainA}My leg�s starting to hurt like hell.
127) OMID
{Body-A}{FearB}Can we maybe have this conversation inside? {PainA}My leg�s starting to hurt like hell.
117) KENNY
{Body-A}{ThinkingA}Looks okay from here, everybody in.
118) BEN
{Body-A}{HappyB}Yeah, way to go.
119) LEE
[impressed] {Body-B}{HappyC}Good job, Clem!
120) CLEMENTINE
{Body-Stand}{HappyB}I did good, right?
121) LEE
{HappyB}Yes you did. {HappyA}You did good.
122) LEE
{Body-B}{HappyA}Good work, Clem. {ThinkingA}But don�t go shooting off like that without asking first, okay?
123) CLEMENTINE
{Body-HandOnWrist}{SadB}I was just trying to help.
124) LEE
{SadA}I know. {HappyA}And you did good. {NormalD}You just had me worried there for a minute.
125) CLEMENTINE

{Body-A}{AngryB}Lee, instead of just standing there like a goddamned mute, {AngryC}maybe you could give us a hand here!
164) LEE
{Body-B}{NormalC}No way we're gonna force that open. {ThinkingA}Not without making a lot of noise, at least.
165) LEE
{Body-B}{ThinkingB}There's gotta be some way to get in here...
166) LEE
{Body-B}{AngryA}Seems like it's locked from the inside.
259) LEE
{Body-B}{AngryA}Seems like it's locked from the inside.

260) LEE
{Body-B}{DisgustA}Yeah, still locked. {NormalC}Not the best accommodations anyway. {ThinkingA}Probably better to try the house.
168) LEE
{Body-B}{ThinkingA}Maybe this'll open if we can find some way to cut the power.
169) OMID
{Body-A}{SickA}There's nothing to cut, it runs on its own battery. {ThinkingA}I don't think we can just wait around  for it to run out.
170) LEE
{Body-B}{ThinkingA}This has got to be our way in... {ThinkingB}if we can just figure out how to get it open.

247) BEN
[pickup][hushed]{Body-A}{SadA}I don't know. {FearA}It's... {ThinkingA}it's like all he can think about is finding a boat. {NormalB}He definitely doesn't want to talk about Katjaa and Duck. {SadA}At least not with me.
251) LEE
[pickup][hushed, very cold]{Body-B}{AngryB}Yeah well, I figure that's probably for the best.
252) LEE
